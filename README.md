# Zettelstore

**Zettelstore** is a software system for collecting and interlinking
notes (&ldquo;zettel&bdquo;) in order to represent and support
knowledge development. It facilitates key tasks in personal
knowledge management by explicitly implementing the [Zettelkasten
method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten). This method is based
on the creation of numerous individual notes, each capturing a single idea
or unit of information, which are systematically related to one another. As
knowledge is typically accumulated incrementally over time, a primary focus
of Zettelstore is the long-term preservation of these notes, hence the name
&ldquo;Zettelstore.&bdquo;

Its design goals include longevity of stored notes, ease of installation and
operation, security by default, and support for multiple user interfaces. The
latter is realized through an application programming interface that offers
a broader range of operations than the standard web-based user interface. In
this respect, Zettelstore serves as an example of sovereign, long-term-capable
software that preserves user control over data.

Beyond its practical utility, Zettelstore is internally structured using
a clean hexagonal architecture. As such, it may also serve as a case study or
reference implementation in university-level courses on software architecture
and system design.

To get an initial impression, take a look at the
[manual](https://zettelstore.de/manual/). It is a live example of the
zettelstore software, running in read-only mode.

[Zettelstore Client](https://t73f.de/r/zsc) provides client software to access
Zettelstore via its API more easily, [Zettelstore
Contrib](https://zettelstore.de/contrib) contains contributed software, which
often connects to Zettelstore via its API. Some of the software packages may be
experimental.
