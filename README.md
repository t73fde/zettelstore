# Zettelstore

**Zettelstore** is a software that collects and relates your notes
(&ldquo;zettel&rdquo;) to represent and enhance your knowledge. It helps with
many tasks of personal knowledge management by explicitly supporting the
[Zettelkasten method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten). The method
is based on creating many individual notes, each with one idea or information,
that are related to each other. Since knowledge is typically build up
gradually, one major focus is a long-term store of these notes, hence the name
&ldquo;Zettelstore&rdquo;.

To get an initial impression, take a look at the
[manual](https://zettelstore.de/manual/). It is a live example of the
zettelstore software, running in read-only mode.
