<title>Limitations and planned improvements</title>

Here is a list of some shortcomings of Zettelstore.
They are planned to be solved.

  *  Zettelstore must have indexed all zettel to make use of queries.
     Otherwise not all zettel may be returned.
  *  Quoted attribute values are not yet supported in Zettelmarkup:
     <code>{key="value with space"}</code>.
  *  The horizontal tab character (<tt>U+0009</tt>) is not supported.
  *  Missing support for citation keys.
  *  Changing the content syntax is not reflected in file extension.
  *  File names with additional text besides the zettel identifier are not
     always preserved.
  *  Some file systems differentiate filenames with different cases (e.g. some
     on Linux, sometimes on macOS), others do not (default on macOS, most on
     Windows). Zettelstore is not able to detect these differences. Do not put
     files in your directory boxes and in files boxes that differ only by upper
     / lower case letters.
  *  &hellip;
