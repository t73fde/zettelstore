<title>Limitations and planned improvements</title>

Here is a list of some shortcomings of Zettelstore.
They are planned to be solved.

<h3>Serious limitations</h3>
  *  Content with binary data (e.g. a GIF, PNG, or JPG file) cannot be created
     nor modified via the standard web interface. As a workaround, you should
     put your file into the directory where your zettel are stored. Make sure
     that the file name starts with unique 14 digits that make up the zettel
     identifier.
  *  Automatic lists and transclusions are not supported in Zettelmarkup.
  *  &hellip;

<h3>Smaller limitations</h3>
  *  Quoted attribute values are not yet supported in Zettelmarkup:
     <code>{key="value with space"}</code>.
  *  The <tt>file</tt> sub-command currently does not support output format
     &ldquo;json&rdquo;.
  *  The horizontal tab character (<tt>U+0009</tt>) is not supported.
  *  Missing support for citation keys.
  *  Changing the content syntax is not reflected in file extension.
  *  File names with additional text besides the zettel identifier are not
     always preserved.
  *  Backspace character in links does not always work, esp. for <tt>\|</tt> or
     <tt>\]</tt>.
  *  &hellip;

<h3>Planned improvements</h3>
  *  Support for mathematical content is missing, e.g. <code>$$F(x) &=
     \\int^a_b \\frac{1}{3}x^3$$</code>.
  *  Render zettel in [https://pandoc.org|pandoc's] JSON version of
     their native AST to make pandoc an external renderer for Zettelstore.
  *  &hellip;
