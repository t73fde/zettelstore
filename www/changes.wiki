<h2>Changes for Version 0.8.0 (pending)</h2>
  *  Remove support for tags within zettel content. Removes also property
     metadata keys <tt>all-tags</tt> and <tt>computed-tags</tt>. Deprecated in
     version 0.7.0.
     (breaking: zettelmarkup, api, webui)
  *  Remove API endpoint <tt>/m</tt>, which retrieve aggregated (tags, roles)
     zettel identifier. Deprecated in version 0.7.0.
     (breaking: api)
  *  Remove support for URL query parameter starting with an underscore.
     Deprecated in version 0.7.0.
     (breaking: api, webui)
  *  Endpoint <tt>/q</tt> returns list of full metadata, if no query action is
     specified.
     (major: api)
  *  Allow transclusion to reference local image via URL.
     (minor: zettelmarkup)
  *  Ignore entities with code point that is not allowed in HTML.
     (minor: zettelmarkup)
  *  Endpoint <tt>/j</tt> is to be replaced by endpoint <tt>/q</tt>.
     It will be removed in version 0.9.0.
     (deprecated: api)

<h2>Changes for Version 0.7.1 (2022-09-18)</h2>
  *  Produce a RSS feed compatible to Miniflux.
     (minor)
  *  Make sure to always produce a pubdata in RSS feed.
     (bug)
  *  Prefix search for data that looks like a zettel identifier may end with a
     <tt>0</tt>.
     (bug)
  *  Fix glitch on manual zettel.
     (bug)

<h2>Changes for Version 0.7.0 (2022-09-17)</h2>
  *  Removes support for URL query parameter to search for metadata values,
     sorting, offset, and limit a zettel list. Deprecated in version 0.6.0
     (breaking: api, webui)
  *  Allow to search for the existence / non-existence of a metadata key with
     the "?" operator: <tt>key?</tt> and <tt>key!?</tt>. Previously, the ":"
     operator was used for this by specifying an empty search value. Now you
     can use the ":" operator to find empty / non-empty metadata values. If you
     specify a search operator for metadata, the specified key is assumed to
     exist.
     (breaking: api, webui)
  *  Rename &ldquo;search expression&rdquo; into &ldquo;query
     expressions&rdquo;. Similar, the reference prefix <tt>search:</tt> to
     specify a query link or a query transclusion is renamed to <tt>query:</tt>
     (breaking: zettelmarkup)
  *  Rename query parameter for query expression from <tt>_s</tt> to
     <tt>q</tt>.
     (breaking: api, webui)
  *  Cleanup names for HTTP query parameters in WebUI. Update your bookmarks
     if you used them. (For API: see below)
     (breaking: webui)
  *  Allow search terms to be OR-ed. This allows to specify any search
     expression in disjunctive normal form. Therefore, the NEGATE term is not
     needed any more.
     (breaking: api, webui)
  *  Replace runtime configuration <tt>default-lang</tt> with <tt>lang</tt>.
     Additionally, <tt>lang</tt> set at the zettel of the current user, will
     provide a default value for the current user, overwriting the global
     default value.
     (breaking)
  *  Add new syntax <tt>pikchr</tt>, a markup language for diagrams in
     technical documentation.
     (major)
  *  Add endpoint <tt>/q</tt> to query the zettelstore and aggregate resulting
     values. This is done by extending the query syntax.
     (major: api)
  *  Add support for query actions. Actions may aggregate w.r.t. some metadata
     keys, or produce an RSS feed.
     (major: api, webui)
  *  Query results can be ordered for more than one metadata key. Ordering by
     zettel identifier is an implicit last order expression to produce stable
     results.
     (minor: api, webui)
  *  Add support for an asset directory, accessible via URL prefix
     <tt>/assests/</tt>.
     (minor: server)
  *  Add support for metadata key <tt>created</tt>, a timestamp when the zettel
     was created. Since key <tt>published</tt> is now either <tt>created</tt>
     or <tt>modified</tt>, it will now always contains a valid time stamp.
     (minor)
  *  Add support for metadata key <tt>author</tt>. It will be displayed on a
     zettel, if set.
     (minor: webui)
  *  Remove CSS for lists. The browsers default value for <tt>padding-left</tt>
     will be used.
     (minor: webui)
  *  Removed templates for rendering roles and tags lists. This is now done by
     query actions.
     (minor: webui)
  *  Tags within zettel content are deprecated in version 0.8. This affects the
     computed metadata keys <tt>content-tags</tt> and <tt>all-tags</tt>. They
     will be removed. The number sign of a content tag introduces unintended
     tags, esp. in the english language; content tags may occur within links
     &rarr; links within links, when rendered as HTML; content tags may occur
     in the title of a zettel; naming of content tags, zettel tags, and their
     union is confusing for many. Migration: use zettel tags or replace content
     tag with a search.
     (deprecated: zettelmarkup)
  *  Cleanup names for HTTP query parameter for API calls. Essentially,
     underscore characters in front are removed. Please use new names, old
     names will be deprecated in version 0.8.
     (deprecated: api)
  *  Some smaller bug fixes and improvements, to the software and to the
     documentation.

<h2>Changes for Version 0.6.2 (2022-08-22)</h2>
  *  Recognize renaming of zettel file external to Zettelstore.
     (bug)

<h2>Changes for Version 0.6.1 (2022-08-22)</h2>
  *  Ignore empty tags when reading metadata.
     (bug)

<h2>Changes for Version 0.6.0 (2022-08-11)</h2>
  *  Translating of "..." into horizontal ellipsis is no longer supported. Use
     &amp;hellip; instead.
     (breaking: zettelmarkup)
  *  Allow to specify search expressions, which allow to specify search
     criterias by using a simple syntax. Can be specified in WebUI's search box
     and via the API by using query parameter "_s".
     (major: api, webui)
  *  A link reference is allowed to be a search expression. The WebUI will
     render this as a link to a list of zettel that satisfy the search
     expression.
     (major: zettelmarkup, webui)
  *  A block transclusion is allowed to specify a search expression. When
     evaluated, the transclusion is replaced by a list of zettel that satisfy
     the search expression.
     (major: zettelmarkup)
  *  When presenting a zettel list, allow to change the search expression.
     (minor: webui)
  *  When evaluating a zettel, ignore transclusions if current user is not
     allowed to read transcluded zettel.
     (minor)
  *  Added a small tutorial for Zettelmarkup.
     (minor: manual)
  *  Using URL query parameter to search for metdata values, specify an
     ordering, an offset, and a limit for the resulting list, will be removed
     in version 0.7. Replace these with the more useable search expressions.
     Please be aware that the = search operator is also deprecated. It was only
     introduced to help the migration.
     (deprecated: api, webui)
  *  Some smaller bug fixes and improvements, to the software and to the
     documentation.

<h2>Changes for Version 0.5.1 (2022-08-02)</h2>
  *  Log missing authentication tokens in debug level (was: sense level)
     (major)
  *  Allow to use empty metadata values of string and zmk types.
     (minor)
  *  Add IP address to some log messages, esp. when authentication fails.
     (minor)

<h2>Changes for Version 0.5.0 (2022-07-29)</h2>
  *  Removed zettel syntax &ldquo;draw&rdquo;. The new default syntax for
     inline zettel is now &ldquo;text&rdquo;. A drawing can now be made by
     using the &ldquo;evaluation block&rdquo; syntax (see below) by setting
     the generic attribute to &ldquo;draw&rdquo;.
     (breaking: zettelmarkup, api, webui)
  *  If authentication is enabled, a secret of at least 16 bytes must be set in
     the startup configuration.
     (breaking)
  *  &ldquo;Sexpr&rdquo; encoding replaces &ldquo;Native&rdquo; encoding. Sexpr
     encoding is much easier to parse, compared with native and ZJSON encoding.
     In most cases it is smaller than ZJSON.
     (breaking: api)
  *  Endpoint <tt>/r</tt> is changed to <tt>/m?_key=role</tt> and returns now
     a map of role names to the list of zettel having this role. Endpoint
     <tt>/t</tt> is changed to <tt>/m?_key=tags</tt>. It already returned
     mapping described before.
     (breaking: api)
  *  Remove support for a default value for metadata key title, role, and
     syntax. Title and role are now allowed to be empty, an empty syntax value
     defaults to &ldquo;plain&rdquo;.
     (breaking)
  *  Add support for an &ldquo;evaluation block&rdquo; syntax in Zettelmarkup
     to allow interpretation of content by external software.
     (minor: zettelmarkup)
  *  Add initial support for a TeX-like math-mode to Zettelmarkup (both block-
     and inline-structured elements). Currently, support only the syntax,
     but WebUI does not render these elements in a special way.
     (minor: zettelmarkup)
  *  For block-structured elements, attributes may now span more than one line.
     If a line ending occurs within a quoted attribute value, the line ending
     characters are part of the attributes value.
     (minor: zettelmarkup)
  *  Zettel 00000000029000 acts as a map of zettel roles to identifier of
     zettel that are included as additional CSS. Allows to display zettel
     differently depending on their role. Use case: slides that are processed
     by Zettel Presenter will use the same CSS if they are rendered by
     Zettelstore WebUI.
     (minor: webui)
  *  A zettel can be saved while creating / editing it. There is no need to
     manually re-edit it by using the 'e' endpoint.
     (minor: webui)
  *  Zettel role and zettel syntax are backed by a HTML5 data list element
     which lists supported and used values to help to enter a valid value.
     (mirnor: webui)
  *  Allow to use startup configuration, even if started in simple mode.
     (minor)
  *  Log authentication issues in level "sense"; add caller IP address to some
     web server log messages.
     (minor: web server)
  *  New startup configuration key <kbd>max-request-size</kbd> to limit a web
     request body to prevent client sending too large requests.
     (minor: web server)
  *  Many smaller bug fixes and improvements, to the software and to the
     documentation.

<h2>Changes for Version 0.4 (2022-03-08)</h2>
  *  Encoding &ldquo;djson&rdquo; renamed to &ldquo;zjson&rdquo; (<em>zettel
     json</em>).
     (breaking: api; minor: webui)
  *  Remove inline quotation syntax <tt>&lt;&lt;...&lt;&lt;</tt>. Now,
     <tt>&quot;&quot;...&quot;&quot;</tt> generates the equivalent code.
     Typographical quotes are generated by the browser, not by Zettelstore.
     (breaking: Zettelmarkup)
  *  Remove inline formatting for monospace. Its syntax is now used by the
     similar syntax element of literal computer input. Monospace was just
     a visual element with no semantic association. Now, the syntax
     <kbd>++...++</kbd> is obsolete.
     (breaking: Zettelmarkup).
  *  Remove API call to parse Zettelmarkup texts and encode it as text and
     HTML. Was call &ldquo;POST /v&rdquo;. It was needed to separately encode
     the titles of zettel. The same effect can be achieved by fetching the
     ZJSON representation and encode it using the function in the Zettelstore
     client software.
     (breaking: api)
  *  Remove API call to retrieve all links of an zettel. This can be done more
     easily on the client side by traversing the ZJSON encoding of a zettel.
     (breaking: api)
  *  ZJSON will encode metadata value as pairs of a metadata type and metadata
     value. This allows a client to decode the associated value more easily.
     (minor: api)
  *  A sequence of inline-structured elements can be marked, not just a point
     in the Zettelmarkup text.
     (minor: zettelmarkup)
  *  Metadata keys with suffix <kbd>-title</kbd> force their value to be
     interpreted as Zettelmarkup. Similar, the suffix <kbd>-set</kbd> denotes
     a set/list of words and the suffix <kbd>-zids</kbd> a set/list of zettel
     identifier.
     (minor: api, webui)
  *  Change generated URLs for zettel-creation forms. If you have bookmarked
     them, e.g. to create a new zettel, you should update.
     (minor: webui)
  *  Remove support for metadata key <tt>no-index</tt> to suppress indexing
     selected zettel. It was introduced in <a href="#0_0_11">v0.0.11</a>, but
     disallows some future optimizations for searching zettel.
     (minor: api, webui)
  *  Make some metadata-based searches a little bit faster by executing
     a (in-memory-based) full-text search first. Now only those zettel are
     loaded from file that contain the metdata value.
     (minor: api, webui)
  *  Add an API call to retrieve the version of the Zettelstore.
     (minor: api)
  *  Limit the amount of zettel and bytes to be stored in a memory box. Allows
     to use it with public access.
     (minor: box)
  *  Disallow to cache the authentication cookie. Will remove most unexpected
     log-outs when using a mobile device.
     (minor: webui)
  *  Many smaller bug fixes and improvements, to the software and to the
     documentation.

<a name="0_3"></a>
<h2>Changes for Version 0.3 (2022-02-09)</h2>
  *  Zettel files with extension <tt>.meta</tt> are now treated as content
     files. Previoulsy, they were interpreted as metadata files. The
     interpretation as metadata files was deprecated in version 0.2.
     (breaking: directory and file/zip box)
  *  Add syntax &ldquo;draw&rdquo; to produce some graphical representations.
     (major)
  *  Add Zettelmarkup syntax to specify full transclusion of other zettel.
     (major: Zettelmarkup)
  *  Add Zettelmarkup syntax to specify inline-zettel, both for
     block-structured and for inline-structured elements.
     (major: Zettelmarkup)
  *  Metadata-returning API calls additionally return an indication about
     access rights for the given zettel.
     (minor: api)
  *  A previously duplicate file that is now useful (because another file was
     deleted) is now logged as such.
     (minor: directory and file/zip box)
  *  Many smaller bug fixes and improvements, to the software and to the
     documentation.

<a name="0_2"></a>
<h2>Changes for Version 0.2 (2022-01-19)</h2>
  *  v0.2.1 (2021-02-01) updates the license year in some documents
  *  Remove support for <tt>;;small text;;</tt> Zettelmarkup.
     (breaking: Zettelmarkup)
  *  On macOS, the downloadable executable program is now called
     &ldquo;zettelstore&rdquo;, as on all other Unix-like platforms.
     (possibly breaking: macOS)
  *  External metadata (e.g. for zettel with file extension other than
     <tt>.zettel</tt>) are stored in files without an extension. Metadata files
     with extension <tt>.meta</tt> are still recognized, but result in
     a warning message. In a future version (probably v0.3), <tt>.meta</tt>
     files will be treated as ordinary content files, possibly resulting in
     duplicate content. In other words: usage of <tt>.meta</tt> files for
     storing metadata is deprecated.
     (possibly breaking: directory and file box)
  *  Show unlinked references in info page of each zettel. Unlinked references
     are phrases within zettel content that might reference another zettel with
     the same title as the phase.
     (major: webui)
  *  Add endpoint <tt>/u/{ID}</tt> to retrieve unlinked references.
     (major: api)
  *  Provide a logging facility.
     Log messages are written to standard output. Messages with level
     &ldquo;information&rdquo; are also written to a circular buffer (of length
     8192) which can be retrieved via a computed zettel. There is a command
     line flag <tt>-l LEVEL</tt> to specify an application global logging level
     on startup (default: &ldquo;information&rdquo;). Logging level can also be
     changed via the administrator console, even for specific (sub-) services.
     (major)
  *  The internal handling of zettel files is rewritten. This allows less
     reloads ands detects when the directory containing the zettel files is
     removed. The API, WebUI, and the admin console allow to manually refresh
     the internal state on demand.
     (major: box, webui)
  *  <tt>.zettel</tt> files with YAML header are now correctly written.
     (bug)
  *  Selecting zettel based on their metadata allows the same syntax as
     searching for zettel content. For example, you can list all zettel that
     have an identifier not ending with <tt>00</tt> by using the query
     <tt>id=!&lt;00</tt>.
     (minor: api, webui)
  *  Remove support for <tt>//deprecated emphasized//</tt> Zettelmarkup.
     (minor: Zettelmarkup)
  *  Add options to profile the software. Profiling can be enabled at the
     command line or via the administrator console.
     (minor)
  *  Add computed zettel that lists all supported parser / recognized zettel
     syntaxes.
     (minor)
  *  Add API call to check for enabled authentication.
     (minor: api)
  *  Renewing an API access token works even if authentication is not enabled.
     This corresponds to the behaviour of optaining an access token.
     (minor: api)
  *  If there is nothing to return, use HTTP status code 204, instead of 200 +
     <tt>Content-Length: 0</tt>.
     (minor: api)
  *  Metadata key <tt>duplicates</tt> stores the duplicate file names, instead
     of just a boolean value that there were duplicate file names.
     (minor)
  *  Document autostarting Zettelstore on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
     (minor)
  *  Many smaller bug fixes and improvements, to the software and to the
     documentation.

<h2>Changes for Version 0.1 (2021-11-11)</h2>
  *  v0.1.3 (2021-12-15) fixes a bug where the modification date could be set
     when a new zettel is created.
  *  v0.1.2 (2021-11-18) fixes a bug when selecting zettel from a list when
     more than one comparison is negated.
  *  v0.1.1 (2021-11-12) updates the documentation, mostly related to the
     deprecation of the <tt>//</tt> markup.
  *  Remove visual Zettelmarkup (italic, underline). Semantic Zettelmarkup
     (emphasize, insert) is still allowed, but got a different syntax. The new
     syntax for <ins>inserted text</ins> is <tt>&gt;&gt;inserted&gt;&gt;</tt>,
     while its previous syntax now denotes <em>emphasized text</em>:
     <tt>__emphasized__</tt>. The previous syntax for emphasized text is now
     deprecated: <tt>//deprecated emphasized//</tt>. Starting with
     Version&nbsp;0.2.0, the deprecated syntax will not be supported. The
     reason is the collision with URLs that also contain the characters
     <tt>//</tt>. The ZMK encoding of a zettel may help with the transition
     (<tt>/v/{ZettelID}?_part=zettel&amp;_enc=zmk</tt>, on the Info page of
     each zettel in the WebUI). Additionally, all deprecated uses of
     <tt>//</tt> will be rendered with a dashed box within the WebUI.
     (breaking: Zettelmarkup).
  *  API client software is now a [https://zettelstore.de/client/|separate]
     project.
     (breaking)
  *  Initial support for HTTP security headers (Content-Security-Policy,
     Permissions-Policy, Referrer-Policy, X-Content-Type-Options,
     X-Frame-Options). Header values are currently some constant values.
     (possibly breaking: api, webui)
  *  Remove visual Zettelmarkup (bold, striketrough). Semantic Zettelmarkup
     (strong, delete) is still allowed and replaces the visual elements
     syntactically. The visual appearance should not change (depends on your
     changes / additions to CSS zettel).
     (possibly breaking: Zettelmarkup).
  *  Add API endpoint <tt>POST /v</tt> to retrieve HTMl and text encoded
     strings from given ZettelMarkup encoded values. This will be used to
     render a HTML page from a given zettel: in many cases the title of
     a zettel must be treated separately.
     (minor: api)
  *  Add API endpoint <tt>/m</tt> to retrieve only the metadata of a zettel.
     (minor: api)
  *  New metadata value <tt>content-tags</tt> contains the tags that were given
     in the zettel content. To put it simply, <tt>all-tags</tt> = <tt>tags</tt>
     + <tt>content-tags</tt>.
     (minor)
  *  Calculating the context of a zettel stops at the home zettel.
     (minor: api, webui)
  *  When renaming or deleting a zettel, a warning will be given, if other
     zettel references the given zettel, or when &ldquo;deleting&rdquo; will
     uncover zettel in overlay box.
     (minor: webui)
  *  Fix: do not allow control characters in JSON-based creating/updating API.
     Otherwise, the created / updated zettel might not be parseable by the
     software (but still by a human). In certain cases, even the WebUI might be
     affected.
     (minor: api, webui)
  *  Fix: when a very long word (longer than width of browser window) is given,
     still allow to scroll horizontally.
     (minor: webui)
  *  Separate repository for [https://zettelstore.de/contrib/|contributed]
     software. First entry is a software for creating a presentation by using
     zettel.
     (info)
  *  Many smaller bug fixes and improvements, to the software and to the
     documentation.

<h2>Changes for Version 0.0.15 (2021-09-17)</h2>
  *  Move again endpoint characters for authentication to make room for future
     features. WebUI authentication moves from <tt>/a</tt> to <tt>/i</tt>
     (login) and <tt>/i?logout</tt> (logout). API authentication moves from
     <tt>/v</tt> to </tt>/a</tt>. JSON-based basic zettel handling moves from
     <tt>/z</tt> to <tt>/j</tt> and <tt>/z/{ID}</tt> to <tt>/j/{ID}</tt>. Since
     the API client is updated too, this should not be a breaking change for
     most users.
     (minor: api, webui; possibly breaking)
  *  Add API endpoint <tt>/v/{ID}</tt> to retrieve an evaluated zettel in
     various encodings. Mostly replaces endpoint <tt>/z/{ID}</tt> for other
     encodings except &ldquo;json&rdquo; and &ldquo;raw&rdquo;. Endpoint
     <tt>/j/{ID}</tt> now only returns JSON data, endpoint <tt>/z/{ID}</tt> is
     used to retrieve plain zettel data (previously called &ldquo;raw&rdquo;).
     See documentation for details.
     (major: api; breaking)
  *  Metadata values of type <em>tag set</em> (the metadata with key
     <tt>tags</tt> is its most prominent example), are now compared in
     a case-insensitive manner. Tags that only differ in upper / lower case
     character are now treated identical. This might break your workflow, if
     you depend on case-sensitive comparison of tag values. Tag values are
     translated to their lower case equivalent before comparing them and when
     you edit a zettel through Zettelstore. If you just modify the zettel
     files, your tag values remain unchanged.
     (major; breaking)
  *  Endpoint <tt>/z/{ID}</tt> allows the same methods as endpoint
     <tt>/j/{ID}</tt>: <tt>GET</tt> retrieves zettel (see above), <tt>PUT</tt>
     updates a zettel, <tt>DELETE</tt> deletes a zettel, <tt>MOVE</tt> renames
     a zettel. In addtion, <tt>POST /z</tt> will create a new zettel. When
     zettel data must be given, the format is plain text, with metadata
     separated from content by an empty line. See documentation for more
     details.
     (major: api (plus WebUI for some details))
  *  Allows to transclude / expand the content of another zettel into a target
     zettel when the zettel is rendered. By using the syntax of embedding an
     image (which is some kind of expansion too), the first top-level paragraph
     of a zettel may be transcluded into the target zettel. Endless recursion
     is checked, as well as a possible &ldquo;transclusion bomb &rdquo;
     (similar to a XML bomb). See manual for details.
     (major: zettelmarkup)
  *  The endpoint <tt>/z</tt> allows to list zettel in a simpler format than
     endpoint <tt>/j</tt>: one line per zettel, and only zettel identifier plus
     zettel title.
     (minor: api)
  *  Folgezettel are now displayed with full title at the bottom of a page.
     (minor: webui)
  *  Add API endpoint <tt>/p/{ID}</tt> to retrieve a parsed, but not evaluated
     zettel in various encodings.
     (minor: api)
  *  Fix: do not list a shadowed zettel that matches the select criteria.
     (minor)
  *  Many smaller bug fixes and improvements, to the software and to the
     documentation.

<h2>Changes for Version 0.0.14 (2021-07-23)</h2>
  *  Rename &ldquo;place&rdquo; into &ldquo;box&rdquo;. This also affects the
     configuration keys to specify boxes <tt>box-uri<em>X</em></tt> (previously
     <tt>place-uri-<em>X</em></tt>. Older changes documented here are renamed
     too.
     (breaking)
  *  Add API for creating, updating, renaming, and deleting zettel.
     (major: api)
  *  Initial API client for Go.
     (major: api)
  *  Remove support for paging of WebUI list. Runtime configuration key
     <tt>list-page-size</tt> is removed. If you still specify it, it will be
     ignored.
     (major: webui)
  *  Use endpoint <tt>/v</tt> for user authentication via API. Endpoint
     <tt>/a</tt> is now used for the web user interface only. Similar, endpoint
     <tt>/y</tt> (&ldquo;zettel context&rdquo;) is renamed to <tt>/x</tt>.
     (minor, possibly breaking)
  *  Type of used-defined metadata is determined by suffix of key:
     <tt>-number</tt>, <tt>-url</tt>, <tt>-zid</tt> will result the values to
     be interpreted as a number, an URL, or a zettel identifier.
     (minor, but possibly breaking if you already used a metadata key with
     above suffixes, but as a string type)
  *  New <tt>user-role</tt> &ldquo;creator&rdquo;, which is only allowed to
     create new zettel (except user zettel). This role may only read and update
     public zettel or its own user zettel. Added to support future client
     software (e.g. on a mobile device) that automatically creates new zettel
     but, in case of a password loss, should not allow to read existing zettel.
     (minor, possibly breaking, because new zettel template zettel must always
     prepend the string <tt>new-</tt> before metdata keys that should be
     transferred to the new zettel)
  *  New suported metadata key <tt>box-number</tt>, which gives an indication
     from which box the zettel was loaded.
     (minor)
  *  New supported syntax <tt>html</tt>.
     (minor)
  *  New predefined zettel &ldquo;User CSS&rdquo; that can be used to redefine
     some predefined CSS (without modifying the base CSS zettel).
     (minor: webui)
  *  When a user moves a zettel file with additional characters into the box
     directory, these characters are preserved when zettel is updated.
     (bug)
  *  The phase &ldquo;filtering a zettel list&rdquo; is more precise
     &ldquo;selecting zettel&rdquo;
     (documentation)
  *  Many smaller bug fixes and improvements, to the software and to the
     documentation.

<h2>Changes for Version 0.0.13 (2021-06-01)</h2>
  *  Startup configuration <tt>box-<em>X</em>-uri</tt> (where <em>X</em> is a
     number greater than zero) has been renamed to
     <tt>box-uri-<em>X</em></tt>.
     (breaking)
  *  Web server processes startup configuration <tt>url-prefix</tt>. There is
     no need for stripping the prefix by a front-end web server any more.
     (breaking: webui, api)
  *  Administrator console (only optional accessible locally). Enable it only
     on systems with a single user or with trusted users. It is disabled by
     default.
     (major: core)
  *  Remove visibility value &ldquo;simple-expert&rdquo; introduced in
     [#0_0_8|version 0.0.8]. It was too complicated, esp. authorization. There
     was a name collision with the &ldquo;simple&rdquo; directory box sub-type.
     (major)
  *  For security reasons, HTML blocks are not encoded as HTML if they contain
     certain snippets, such as <tt>&lt;script</tt> or <tt>&lt;iframe</tt>.
     These may be caused by using CommonMark as a zettel syntax.
     (major)
  *  Full-text search can be a prefix search or a search for equal words, in
     addition to the search whether a word just contains word of the search
     term.
     (minor: api, webui)
  *  Full-text search for URLs, with above additional operators.
     (minor: api, webui)
  *  Add system zettel about license, contributors, and dependencies (and their
     license).
     For a nicer layout of zettel identifier, the zettel about environment
     values and about runtime metrics got new zettel identifier. This affects
     only user that referenced those zettel.
     (minor)
  *  Local images that cannot be read (not found or no access rights) are
     substituted with the new default image, a spinning emoji.
     See [/file?name=box/constbox/emoji_spin.gif].
     (minor: webui)
  *  Add zettelmarkup syntax for a table row that should be ignored:
     <tt>|%</tt>. This allows to paste output of the administrator console into
     a zettel.
     (minor: zmk)
  *  Many smaller bug fixes and improvements, to the software and to the
     documentation.

<a name="0_0_12"></a>
<h2>Changes for Version 0.0.12 (2021-04-16)</h2>
  *  Raise the per-process limit of open files on macOS to 1.048.576. This
     allows most macOS users to use at least 500.000 zettel. That should be
     enough for the near future.
     (major)
  *  Mitigate the shortcomings of the macOS version by introducing types of
     directory boxes. The original directory box type is now called "notify"
     (the default value). There is a new type called "simple". This new type
     does not notify Zettelstore when some of the underlying Zettel files
     change.
     (major)
  *  Add new startup configuration <tt>default-dir-box-type</tt>, which gives
     the default value for specifying a directory box type. The default value
     is &ldquo;notify&rdquo;. On macOS, the default value may be changed
     &ldquo;simple&rdquo; if some errors occur while raising the per-process
     limit of open files.
     (minor)

<a name="0_0_11"></a>
<h2>Changes for Version 0.0.11 (2021-04-05)</h2>
  *  New box schema "file" allows to read zettel from a ZIP file.
     A zettel collection can now be packaged and distributed easier.
     (major: server)
  *  Non-restricted search is a full-text search. The search string will be
     normalized according to Unicode NFKD. Every character that is not a letter
     or a number will be ignored for the search. It is sufficient if the words
     to be searched are part of words inside a zettel, both content and
     metadata.
     (major: api, webui)
  *  A zettel can be excluded from being indexed (and excluded from being found
     in a search) if it contains the metadata <tt>no-index: true</tt>.
     (minor: api, webui)
  *  Menu bar is shown when displaying error messages.
     (minor: webui)
  *  When selecting zettel, it can be specified that a given value should
     <em>not</em> match. Previously, only the whole select criteria could be
     negated (which is still possible).
     (minor: api, webui)
  *  You can select a zettel by specifying that specific metadata keys must
     (or must not) be present.
     (minor: api, webui)
  *  Context of a zettel (introduced in version 0.0.10) does not take tags into
     account any more. Using some tags for determining the context resulted
     into erratic, non-deterministic context lists.
     (minor: api, webui)
  *  Selecting zettel depending on tag values can be both by comparing only the
     prefix or the whole string. If a search value begins with '#', only zettel
     with the exact tag will be returned. Otherwise a zettel will be returned
     if the search string just matches the prefix of only one of its tags.
     (minor: api, webui)
  *  Many smaller bug fixes and improvements, to the software and to the documentation.

A note for users of macOS: in the current release and with macOS's default
values, a zettel directory must not contain more than approx. 250 files. There
are three options to mitigate this limitation temporarily:
  #  You update the per-process limit of open files on macOS.
  #  You setup a virtualization environment to run Zettelstore on Linux or Windows.
  #  You wait for version 0.0.12 which addresses this issue.

<h2>Changes for Version 0.0.10 (2021-02-26)</h2>
  *  Menu item &ldquo;Home&rdquo; now redirects to a home zettel.
     Its default identifier is <tt>000100000000</tt>.
     The identifier can be changed with configuration key <tt>home-zettel</tt>, which supersedes key <tt>start</tt>.
     The default home zettel contains some welcoming information for the new user.
     (major: webui)
  *  Show context of a zettel by following all backward and/or forward reference
     up to a defined depth and list the resulting zettel. Additionally, some zettel
     with similar tags as the initial zettel are also taken into account.
     (major: api, webui)
  *  A zettel that references other zettel within first-level list items, can act
     as a &ldquo;table of contents&rdquo; zettel.
     The API endpoint <tt>/o/{ID}</tt> allows to retrieve the referenced zettel in
     the same order as they occur in the zettel.
     (major: api)
  *  The zettel &ldquo;New Menu&rdquo; with identifier <tt>00000000090000</tt> contains
     a list of all zettel that should act as a template for new zettel.
     They are listed in the WebUIs &rdquo;New&ldquo; menu.
     This is an application of the previous item.
     It supersedes the usage of a role <tt>new-template</tt> introduced in [#0_0_6|version 0.0.6].
     <b>Please update your zettel if you make use of the now deprecated feature.</b>
     (major: webui)
  *  A reference that starts with two slash characters (&ldquo;<code>//</code>&rdquo;)
     it will be interpreted relative to the value of <code>url-prefix</code>.
     For example, if <code>url-prefix</code> has the value <code>/manual/</code>,
     the reference <code>&lbrack;&lbrack;Zettel list|//h]]</code> will render as
     <code>&lt;a href="/manual/h">Zettel list&lt;/a></code>. (minor: syntax)
  *  Searching/selecting ignores the leading '#' character of tags.
     (minor: api, webui)
  *  When result of selecting or searching is presented, the query is written as the page heading.
     (minor: webui)
  *  A reference to a zettel that contains a URL fragment, will now be processed by the indexer.
     (bug: server)
  *  Runtime configuration key <tt>marker-external</tt> now defaults to
     &ldquo;&amp;#10138;&rdquo; (&ldquo;&#10138;&rdquo;). It is more beautiful
     than the previous &ldquo;&amp;#8599;&amp;#xfe0e;&rdquo;
     (&ldquo;&#8599;&#65038;&rdquo;), which also needed the additional
     &ldquo;&amp;#xfe0e;&rdquo; to disable the conversion to an emoji on iPadOS.
     (minor: webui)
  *  A pre-build binary for macOS ARM64 (also known as Apple silicon) is available.
     (minor: infrastructure)
  *  Many smaller bug fixes and improvements, to the software and to the documentation.

<h2>Changes for Version 0.0.9 (2021-01-29)</h2>
This is the first version that is managed by [https://fossil-scm.org|Fossil]
instead of GitHub. To access older versions, use the Git repository under
[https://github.com/zettelstore/zettelstore-github|zettelstore-github].

<h3>Server / API</h3>
  *  (major) Support for property metadata.
             Metadata key <tt>published</tt> is the first example of such
             a property.
  *  (major) A background activity (called <i>indexer</i>) continuously
             monitors zettel changes to establish the reverse direction of
             found internal links. This affects the new metadata keys
             <tt>precursor</tt> and <tt>folge</tt>. A user specifies the
             precursor of a zettel and the indexer computes the property
             metadata for
             [https://forum.zettelkasten.de/discussion/996/definition-folgezettel|Folgezettel].
             Metadata keys with type &ldquo;Identifier&rdquo; or
             &ldquo;IdentifierSet&rdquo; that have no inverse key (like
             <tt>precursor</tt> and <tt>folge</tt> with add to the key
             <tt>forward</tt> that also collects all internal links within the
             content. The computed inverse is <tt>backward</tt>, which provides
             all backlinks. The key <tt>back</tt> is computed as the value of
             <tt>backward</tt>, but without forward links. Therefore,
             <tt>back</tt> is something like the list of &ldquo;smart
             backlinks&rdquo;.
  *  (minor) If Zettelstore is being stopped, an appropriate message is written
             in the console log.
  *  (minor) New computed zettel with environmental data, the list of supported
             meta data keys, and statistics about all configured zettel boxes.
             Some other computed zettel got a new identifier (to make room for
             other variant).
  *  (minor) Remove zettel <tt>00000000000004</tt>, which contained the Go
             version that produced the Zettelstore executable. It was too
             specific to the current implementation. This information is now
             included in zettel <tt>00000000000006</tt> (<i>Zettelstore
             Environment Values</i>).
  *  (minor) Predefined templates for new zettel do not contain any value for
             attribute <tt>visibility</tt> any more.
  *  (minor) Add a new metadata key type called &ldquo;Zettelmarkup&rdquo;.
             It is a non-empty string, that will be formatted with
             Zettelmarkup. <tt>title</tt> and <tt>default-title</tt> have this
             type.
  *  (major) Rename zettel syntax &ldquo;meta&rdquo; to &ldquo;none&rdquo;.
             Please update the <i>Zettelstore Runtime Configuration</i> and all
             other zettel that previously used the value &ldquo;meta&rdquo;.
             Other zettel are typically user zettel, used for authentication.
             However, there is no real harm, if you do not update these zettel.
             In this case, the metadata is just not presented when rendered.
             Zettelstore will still work.
  *  (minor) Login will take at least 500 milliseconds to mitigate login
             attacks. This affects both the API and the WebUI.
  *  (minor) Add a sort option &ldquo;_random&rdquo; to produce a zettel list
             in random order. <tt>_order</tt> / <tt>order</tt> are now an
             aliases for the query parameters <tt>_sort</tt> / <tt>sort</tt>.

<h3>WebUI</h3>
  *  (major) HTML template zettel for WebUI now use
             [https://mustache.github.io/|Mustache] syntax instead of
             previously used [https://golang.org/pkg/html/template/|Go
             template] syntax. This allows these zettel to be used, even when
             there is another Zettelstore implementation, in another
             programming language. Mustache is available for approx. 48
             programming languages, instead of only one for Go templates. <b>If
             you modified your templates, you <i>must</i> adapt them to the new
             syntax. Otherwise the WebUI will not work.</b>
  *  (major) Show zettel identifier of folgezettel and precursor zettel in the
             header of a rendered zettel. If a zettel has real backlinks, they
             are shown at the botton of the page (&ldquo;Additional links to
             this zettel&rdquo;).
  *  (minor) All property metadata, even computed metadata is shown in the info
             page of a zettel.
  *  (minor) Rendering of metadata keys <tt>title</tt> and
             <tt>default-title</tt> in info page changed to a full HTML output
             for these Zettelmarkup encoded values.
  *  (minor) Always show the zettel identifier on the zettel detail view.
             Previously, the identifier was not shown if the zettel was not
             editable.
  *  (minor) Do not show computed metadata in edit forms anymore.

<a name="0_0_8"></a>
<h2>Changes for Version 0.0.8 (2020-12-23)</h2>
<h3>Server / API</h3>
  *  (bug) Zettel files with extension <tt>.jpg</tt> and without metadata will
           get a <tt>syntax</tt> value &ldquo;jpg&rdquo;. The internal data
           structure got the same value internally, instead of
           &ldquo;jpeg&rdquo;. This has been fixed for all possible alternative
           syntax values.
  *  (bug) If a file, e.g. an image file like <tt>20201130190200.jpg</tt>, is
           added to the directory box, its metadata are just calculated from
           the information available. Updated metadata did not find its way
           into the zettel box, because the <tt>.meta</tt> file was not
           written.
  *  (bug) If just the <tt>.meta</tt> file was deleted manually, the zettel was
           assumed to be missing. A workaround is to restart the software. If
           the <tt>.meta</tt> file is deleted, metadata is now calculated in
           the same way when the <tt>.meta</tt> file is non-existing at the
           start of the software.
  *  (bug) A link to the current zettel, only using a fragment (e.g.
           <code>&#91;&#91;Title|#title]]</code>) is now handled correctly as
           a zettel link (and not as a link to external material).
  *  (minor) Allow zettel to be marked as &ldquo;read only&rdquo;.
             This is done through the metadata key <tt>read-only</tt>.
  *  (bug) When renaming a zettel, check all boxes for the new zettel
           identifier, not just the first one. Otherwise it will be possible to
           shadow a read-only zettel from a next box, effectively modifying it.
  *  (minor) Add support for a configurable default value for metadata key
             <tt>visibility</tt>.
  *  (bug) If <tt>list-page-size</tt> is set to a relatively small value and
           the authenticated user is <i>not</i> the owner, some zettel were not
           shown in the list of zettel or were not returned by the API.
  *  (minor) Add support for new visibility &ldquo;expert&rdquo;.
             An owner becomes an expert, if the runtime configuration key
             <tt>expert-mode</tt> is set to true.
  *  (major) Add support for computed zettel.
             These zettel have an identifier less than <tt>0000000000100</tt>.
             Most of them are only visible, if <tt>expert-mode</tt> is enabled.
  *  (bug)   Fixes a memory leak that results in too many open files after
             approx. 125 reload operations.
  *  (major) Predefined templates for new zettel got an explicit value for
             visibility: &ldquo;login&rdquo;. Please update these zettel if you
             modified them.
  *  (major) Rename key <tt>readonly</tt> of <i>Zettelstore Startup
             Configuration</i> to <tt>read-only-mode</tt>. This was done to
             avoid some confusion with the the zettel metadata key
             <tt>read-only</tt>. <b>Please adapt your startup configuration.
             Otherwise your Zettelstore will be accidentally writable.</b>
  *  (minor) References starting with &ldquo;./&rdquo; and &ldquo;../&rdquo;
             are treated as a local reference. Previously, only the prefix
             &ldquo;/&rdquo; was treated as a local reference.
  *  (major) Metadata key <tt>modified</tt> will be set automatically to the
             current local time if a zettel is updated through Zettelstore.
             <b>If you used that key previously for your own, you should rename
             it before you upgrade.</b>
  *  (minor) The new visibility value &ldquo;simple-expert&rdquo; ensures that
             many computed zettel are shown for new users. This is to enable
             them to send useful bug reports.
  *  (minor) When a zettel is stored as a file, its identifier is additionally
             stored within the metadata. This helps for better robustness in
             case the file names were corrupted. In addition, there could be
             a tool that compares the identifier with the file name.

<h3>WebUI</h3>
  *  (minor) Remove list of tags in &ldquo;List Zettel&rdquo; and search
             results. There was some feedback that the additional tags were not
             helpful.
  *  (minor) Move zettel field "role" above "tags" and move "syntax" more to
             "content".
  *  (minor) Rename zettel operation &ldquo;clone&rdquo; to &ldquo;copy&rdquo;.
  *  (major) All predefined HTML templates have now a visibility value
             &ldquo;expert&rdquo;. If you want to see them as an non-expert
             owner, you must temporary enable <tt>expert-mode</tt> and change
             the <tt>visibility</tt> metadata value.
  *  (minor) Initial support for
             [https://zettelkasten.de/posts/tags/folgezettel/|Folgezettel]. If
             you click on &ldquo;Folge&rdquo; (detail view or info view), a new
             zettel is created with a reference (<tt>precursor</tt>) to the
             original zettel. Title, role, tags, and syntax are copied from the
             original zettel.
  *  (major) Most predefined zettel have a title prefix of
             &ldquo;Zettelstore&rdquo;.
  *  (minor) If started in simple mode, e.g. via double click or without any
             command, some information for the new user is presented. In the
             terminal, there is a hint about opening the web browser and use
             a specific URL. A <i>Welcome zettel</i> is created, to give some
             more information. (This change also applies to the server itself,
             but it is more suited to the WebUI user.)

<a name="0_0_7"></a>
<h2>Changes for Version 0.0.7 (2020-11-24)</h2>
  *  With this version, Zettelstore and this manual got a new license, the
     [https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/eupl|European Union Public
     Licence] (EUPL), version 1.2 or later. Nothing else changed. If you want
     to stay with the old licenses (AGPLv3+, CC BY-SA 4.0), you are free to
     fork from the previous version.

<a name="0_0_6"></a>
<h2>Changes for Version 0.0.6 (2020-11-23)</h2>
<h3>Server</h3>
  *  (major) Rename identifier of <i>Zettelstore Runtime Configuration</i> to
             <tt>00000000000100</tt> (previously <tt>00000000000001</tt>). This
             is done to gain some free identifier with smaller number to be
             used internally. <b>If you customized this zettel, please make
             sure to rename it to the new identifier.</b>
  *  (major) Rename the two essential metadata keys of a user zettel to
             <tt>credential</tt> and <tt>user-id</tt>. The previous values were
             <tt>cred</tt> and <tt>ident</tt>. <b>If you enabled user
             authentication and added some user zettel, make sure to change
             them accordingly. Otherwise these users will not authenticated any
             more.</b>
  *  (minor) Rename the scheme of the box URL where predefined zettel are
             stored to &ldquo;const&rdquo;. The previous value was
             &ldquo;globals&rdquo;.

<h3>Zettelmarkup</h3>
  *  (bug) Allow to specify a <i>fragment</i> in a reference to a zettel.
           Used to link to an internal position within a zettel.
           This applies to CommonMark too.

<h3>API</h3>
  *  (bug)   Encoding binary content in format &ldquo;json&rdquo; now results
             in valid JSON content.
  *  (bug)   All query parameters of selecting zettel must be true, regardless
             if a specific key occurs more than one or not.
  *  (minor) Encode all inherited meta values in all formats except
             &ldquo;raw&rdquo;. A meta value is called <i>inherited</i> if
             there is a key starting with <tt>default-</tt> in the
             <i>Zettelstore Runtime Configuration</i>. Applies to WebUI also.
  *  (minor) Automatic calculated identifier for headings (only for
             &ldquo;html&rdquo;, &ldquo;djson&rdquo;, &ldquo;native&rdquo;
             format and for the Web user interface). You can use this to
             provide a zettel reference that links to the heading, without
             specifying an explicit mark (<code>&#91;!mark]</code>).
  *  (major) Allow to retrieve all references of a given zettel.

<h3>Web user interface (WebUI)</h3>
  *  (minor) Focus on the first text field on some forms (new zettel, edit
             zettel, rename zettel, login)
  *  (major) Adapt all HTML templates to a simpler structure.
  *  (bug)   Rendered wrong URLs for internal links on info page.
  *  (bug)   If a zettel contains binary content it cannot be cloned.
             For such a zettel only the metadata can be changed.
  *  (minor) Non-zettel references that neither have an URL scheme, user info,
             nor host name, are considered &ldquo;local references&rdquo; (in
             contrast to &ldquo;zettel references&rdquo; and &ldquo;external
             references&rdquo;). When a local reference is displayed as an URL
             on the WebUI, it will not opened in a new window/tab. They will
             receive a <i>local</i> marker, when encoded as &ldquo;djson&rdquo;
             or &ldquo;native&rdquo;. Local references are listed on the
             <i>Info page</i> of each zettel.
  *  (minor) Change the default value for some visual sugar putd after an
             external URL to <tt>&\#8599;&\#xfe0e;</tt>
             (&ldquo;&#8599;&#xfe0e;&rdquo;). This affects the former key
             <tt>icon-material</tt> of the <i>Zettelstore Runtime
             Configuration</i>, which is renamed to <tt>marker-external</tt>.
  *  (major) Allow multiple zettel to act as templates for creating new zettel.
             All zettel with a role value &ldquo;new-template&rdquo; act as
             a template to create a new zettel. The WebUI menu item
             &ldquo;New&rdquo; changed to a drop-down list with all those
             zettel, ordered by their identifier. All metadata keys with the
             prefix <tt>new-</tt> will be translated to a new or updated
             keys/value without that prefix. You can use this mechanism to
             specify a role for the new zettel, or a different title. The title
             of the template zettel is used in the drop-down list. The initial
             template zettel &ldquo;New Zettel&rdquo; has now a different
             zettel identifier (now: <tt>00000000091001</tt>, was:
             <tt>00000000040001</tt>). <b>Please update it, if you changed that
             zettel.</b>
             <br>Note: this feature was superseded in [#0_0_10|version 0.0.10]
             by the &ldquo;New Menu&rdquo; zettel.
  *  (minor) When a page should be opened in a new windows (e.g. for external
             references), the web browser is instructed to decouple the new
             page from the previous one for privacy and security reasons. In
             detail, the web browser is instructed to omit referrer information
             and to omit a JS object linking to the page that contained the
             external link.
  *  (minor) If the value of the <i>Zettelstore Runtime Configuration</i> key
             <tt>list-page-size</tt> is greater than zero, the number of WebUI
             list elements will be restricted and it is possible to change to
             the next/previous page to list more elements.
  *  (minor) Change CSS to enhance reading: make <code>line-height</code>
             a little smaller (previous: 1.6, now 1.4) and move list items to
             the left.

<h2>Changes for Version 0.0.5 (2020-10-22)</h2>
  *  Application Programming Interface (API) to allow external software to
     retrieve zettel data from the Zettelstore.
  *  Specify boxes, where zettel are stored, via an URL.
  *  Add support for a custom footer.

<a name="0_0_4"></a>
<h2>Changes for Version 0.0.4 (2020-09-11)</h2>
  *  Optional user authentication/authorization.
  *  New sub-commands <tt>file</tt> (use Zettelstore as a command line filter),
     <tt>password</tt> (for authentication), and <tt>config</tt>.

<a name="0_0_3"></a>
<h2>Changes for Version 0.0.3 (2020-08-31)</h2>
  *  Starting Zettelstore has been changed by introducing sub-commands.
     This change is also reflected on the server installation procedures.
  *  Limitations on renaming zettel has been relaxed.

<a name="0_0_2"></a>
<h2>Changes for Version 0.0.2 (2020-08-28)</h2>
  *  Configuration zettel now has ID <tt>00000000000001</tt> (previously:
     <tt>00000000000000</tt>).
  *  The zettel with ID <tt>00000000000000</tt> is no longer shown in any
     zettel list. If you changed the configuration zettel, you should rename it
     manually in its file directory.
  *  Creating a new zettel is now done by cloning an existing zettel.
     To mimic the previous behaviour, a zettel with ID <tt>00000000040001</tt>
     is introduced. You can change it if you need a different template zettel.

<a name="0_0_1"></a>
<h2>Changes for Version 0.0.1 (2020-08-21)</h2>
  *  Initial public release.
