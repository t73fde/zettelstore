<h2>Changes for Version 0.0.14 (pending)</h2>
  *  Rename &ldquo;place&rdquo; into &ldquo;box&rdquo;. This also affects the
     configuration keys to specify boxes <tt>box-uri<em>X</em></tt> (previously
     <tt>place-uri-<em>X</em></tt>. Older changes documented here are renamed
     too.
     (breaking)
  *  Remove support for paging of WebUI list. Runtime configuration key
     <tt>list-page-size</tt> is removed. If you still specify it, it will be
     ignored.
     (major: webui)
  *  Use endpoint <tt>/v</tt> for user authentication via API. Endpoint
     <tt>/a</tt> is now used for the web user interface only.
     (minor, possibly breaking)
  *  Type of used-defined metadata is determined by suffix of key:
     <tt>-number</tt>, <tt>-url</tt>, <tt>-zid</tt> will result the values to
     be interpreted as a number, an URL, or a zettel identifier.
     (minor, but possibly breaking if you already used a metadata key with
     above suffixes, but as a string type)
  *  New <tt>user-role</tt> &ldquo;creator&rdquo;, which is only allowed to
     create new zettel (except user zettel). This role may only read and update
     public zettel or its own user zettel. Added to support future client
     software (e.g. on a mobile device) that automatically creates new zettel
     but, in case of a password loss, should not allow to read existing zettel.
     (minor, possibly breaking, because new zettel template zettel must always
     prepend the string <tt>new-</tt> before metdata keys that should be
     transferred to the new zettel)
  *  New suported metadata key <tt>box-number</tt>, which gives an indication
     from which box the zettel was loaded.
     (minor)
  *  New supported syntax <tt>html</tt>.
     (minor)
  *  New predefined zettel &ldquo;User CSS&rdquo; that can be used to redefine
     some predefined CSS (without modifying the base CSS zettel).
     (minor: webui)
  *  When a user moves a zettel file with additional characters into the box
     directory, these characters are preserved when zettel is updated.
     (bug)

<h2>Changes for Version 0.0.13 (2021-06-01)</h2>
  *  Startup configuration <tt>box-<em>X</em>-uri</tt> (where <em>X</em> is a
     number greater than zero) has been renamed to
     <tt>box-uri-<em>X</em></tt>.
     (breaking)
  *  Web server processes startup configuration <tt>url-prefix</tt>. There is
     no need for stripping the prefix by a front-end web server any more.
     (breaking: webui, api)
  *  Administrator console (only optional accessible locally). Enable it only
     on systems with a single user or with trusted users. It is disabled by
     default.
     (major: core)
  *  Remove visibility value &ldquo;simple-expert&rdquo; introduced in
     [#0_0_8|version 0.0.8]. It was too complicated, esp. authorization. There
     was a name collision with the &ldquo;simple&rdquo; directory box sub-type.
     (major)
  *  For security reasons, HTML blocks are not encoded as HTML if they contain
     certain snippets, such as <tt>&lt;script</tt> or <tt>&lt;iframe</tt>.
     These may be caused by using CommonMark as a zettel syntax.
     (major)
  *  Full-text search can be a prefix search or a search for equal words, in
     addition to the search whether a word just contains word of the search
     term.
     (minor: api, webui)
  *  Full-text search for URLs, with above additional operators.
     (minor: api, webui)
  *  Add system zettel about license, contributors, and dependencies (and their
     license).
     For a nicer layout of zettel identifier, the zettel about environment
     values and about runtime metrics got new zettel identifier. This affects
     only user that referenced those zettel.
     (minor)
  *  Local images that cannot be read (not found or no access rights) are
     substituted with the new default image, a spinning emoji.
     See [/file?name=box/constbox/emoji_spin.gif].
     (minor: webui)
  *  Add zettelmarkup syntax for a table row that should be ignored:
     <tt>|%</tt>. This allows to paste output of the administrator console into
     a zettel.
     (minor: zmk)
  *  Many smaller bug fixes and inprovements, to the software and to the
     documentation.

<h2>Changes for Version 0.0.12 (2021-04-16)</h2>
  *  Raise the per-process limit of open files on macOS to 1.048.576. This
     allows most macOS users to use at least 500.000 zettel. That should be
     enough for the near future.
     (major)
  *  Mitigate the shortcomings of the macOS version by introducing types of
     directory boxes. The original directory box type is now called "notify"
     (the default value). There is a new type called "simple". This new type
     does not notify Zettelstore when some of the underlying Zettel files
     change.
     (major)
  *  Add new startup configuration <tt>default-dir-box-type</tt>, which gives
     the default value for specifying a directory box type. The default value
     is &ldquo;notify&rdquo;. On macOS, the default value may be changed
     &ldquo;simple&rdquo; if some errors occur while raising the per-process
     limit of open files.
     (minor)

<a name="0_0_11"></a>
<h2>Changes for Version 0.0.11 (2021-04-05)</h2>
  *  New box schema "file" allows to read zettel from a ZIP file.
     A zettel collection can now be packaged and distributed easier.
     (major: server)
  *  Non-restricted search is a full-text search. The search string will
     be normalized according to Unicode NFKD. Every character that is not a letter
     or a number will be ignored for the search. It is sufficient if the words
     to be searched are part of words inside a zettel, both content and metadata.
     (major: api, webui)
  *  A zettel can be excluded from being indexed (and excluded from being found
     in a search) if it contains the metadata <tt>no-index: true</tt>.
     (minor: api, webui)
  *  Menu bar is shown when displaying error messages.
     (minor: webui)
  *  When filtering a list of zettel, it can be specified that a given value should
     <em>not</em> match. Previously, only the whole filter expression could be
     negated (which is still possible).
     (minor: api, webui)
  *  You can filter a zettel list by specifying that specific metadata keys must
     (or must not) be present.
     (minor: api, webui)
  *  Context of a zettel (introduced in version 0.0.10) does not take tags into account any more.
     Using some tags for determining the context resulted into erratic, non-deterministic context lists.
     (minor: api, webui)
  *  Filtering zettel depending on tag values can be both by comparing only the prefix
     or the whole string. If a search value begins with '#', only zettel with the exact
     tag will be returned. Otherwise a zettel will be returned if the search string
     just matches the prefix of only one of its tags.
     (minor: api, webui)
  *  Many smaller bug fixes and inprovements, to the software and to the documentation.

A note for users of macOS: in the current release and with macOS's default
values, a zettel directory must not contain more than approx. 250 files. There
are three options to mitigate this limitation temporarily:
  #  You update the per-process limit of open files on macOS.
  #  You setup a virtualization environment to run Zettelstore on Linux or Windows.
  #  You wait for version 0.0.12 which addresses this issue.

<h2>Changes for Version 0.0.10 (2021-02-26)</h2>
  *  Menu item &ldquo;Home&rdquo; now redirects to a home zettel.
     Its default identifier is <tt>000100000000</tt>.
     The identifier can be changed with configuration key <tt>home-zettel</tt>, which supersedes key <tt>start</tt>.
     The default home zettel contains some welcoming information for the new user.
     (major: webui)
  *  Show context of a zettel by following all backward and/or forward reference
     up to a defined depth and list the resulting zettel. Additionally, some zettel
     with similar tags as the initial zettel are also taken into account.
     (major: api, webui)
  *  A zettel that references other zettel within first-level list items, can act
     as a &ldquo;table of contents&rdquo; zettel.
     The API endpoint <tt>/o/{ID}</tt> allows to retrieve the referenced zettel in
     the same order as they occur in the zettel.
     (major: api)
  *  The zettel &ldquo;New Menu&rdquo; with identifier <tt>00000000090000</tt> contains
     a list of all zettel that should act as a template for new zettel.
     They are listed in the WebUIs &rdquo;New&ldquo; menu.
     This is an application of the previous item.
     It supersedes the usage of a role <tt>new-template</tt> introduced in [#0_0_6|version 0.0.6].
     <b>Please update your zettel if you make use of the now deprecated feature.</b>
     (major: webui)
  *  A reference that starts with two slash characters (&ldquo;<code>//</code>&rdquo;)
     it will be interpreted relative to the value of <code>url-prefix</code>.
     For example, if <code>url-prefix</code> has the value <code>/manual/</code>,
     the reference <code>&lbrack;&lbrack;Zettel list|//h]]</code> will render as
     <code>&lt;a href="/manual/h">Zettel list&lt;/a></code>. (minor: syntax)
  *  Searching/filtering ignores the leading '#' character of tags.
     (minor: api, webui)
  *  When result of filtering or searching is presented, the query is written as the page heading.
     (minor: webui)
  *  A reference to a zettel that contains a URL fragment, will now be processed by the indexer.
     (bug: server)
  *  Runtime configuration key <tt>marker-external</tt> now defaults to
     &ldquo;&amp;#10138;&rdquo; (&ldquo;&#10138;&rdquo;). It is more beautiful
     than the previous &ldquo;&amp;#8599;&amp;#xfe0e;&rdquo;
     (&ldquo;&#8599;&#65038;&rdquo;), which also needed the additional
     &ldquo;&amp;#xfe0e;&rdquo; to disable the conversion to an emoji on iPadOS.
     (minor: webui)
  *  A pre-build binary for macOS ARM64 (also known as Apple silicon) is available.
     (minor: infrastructure)
  *  Many smaller bug fixes and inprovements, to the software and to the documentation.

<h2>Changes for Version 0.0.9 (2021-01-29)</h2>
This is the first version that is managed by [https://fossil-scm.org|Fossil]
instead of GitHub. To access older versions, use the Git repository under
[https://github.com/zettelstore/zettelstore-github|zettelstore-github].

<h3>Server / API</h3>
  *  (major) Support for property metadata.
             Metadata key <tt>published</tt> is the first example of such
             a property.
  *  (major) A background activity (called <i>indexer</i>) continuously
             monitors zettel changes to establish the reverse direction of
             found internal links. This affects the new metadata keys
             <tt>precursor</tt> and <tt>folge</tt>. A user specifies the
             precursor of a zettel and the indexer computes the property
             metadata for
             [https://forum.zettelkasten.de/discussion/996/definition-folgezettel|Folgezettel].
             Metadata keys with type &ldquo;Identifier&rdquo; or
             &ldquo;IdentifierSet&rdquo; that have no inverse key (like
             <tt>precursor</tt> and <tt>folge</tt> with add to the key
             <tt>forward</tt> that also collects all internal links within the
             content. The computed inverse is <tt>backward</tt>, which provides
             all backlinks. The key <tt>back</tt> is computed as the value of
             <tt>backward</tt>, but without forward links. Therefore,
             <tt>back</tt> is something like the list of &ldquo;smart
             backlinks&rdquo;.
  *  (minor) If Zettelstore is being stopped, an appropriate message is written
             in the console log.
  *  (minor) New computed zettel with environmental data, the list of supported
             meta data keys, and statistics about all configured zettel boxes.
             Some other computed zettel got a new identifier (to make room for
             other variant).
  *  (minor) Remove zettel <tt>00000000000004</tt>, which contained the Go
             version that produced the Zettelstore executable. It was too
             specific to the current implementation. This information is now
             included in zettel <tt>00000000000006</tt> (<i>Zettelstore
             Environment Values</i>).
  *  (minor) Predefined templates for new zettel do not contain any value for
             attribute <tt>visibility</tt> any more.
  *  (minor) Add a new metadata key type called &ldquo;Zettelmarkup&rdquo;.
             It is a non-empty string, that will be formatted with
             Zettelmarkup. <tt>title</tt> and <tt>default-title</tt> have this
             type.
  *  (major) Rename zettel syntax &ldquo;meta&rdquo; to &ldquo;none&rdquo;.
             Please update the <i>Zettelstore Runtime Configuration</i> and all
             other zettel that previously used the value &ldquo;meta&rdquo;.
             Other zettel are typically user zettel, used for authentication.
             However, there is no real harm, if you do not update these zettel.
             In this case, the metadata is just not presented when rendered.
             Zettelstore will still work.
  *  (minor) Login will take at least 500 milliseconds to mitigate login
             attacks. This affects both the API and the WebUI.
  *  (minor) Add a sort option &ldquo;_random&rdquo; to produce a zettel list
             in random order. <tt>_order</tt> / <tt>order</tt> are now an
             aliases for the query parameters <tt>_sort</tt> / <tt>sort</tt>.

<h3>WebUI</h3>
  *  (major) HTML template zettel for WebUI now use
             [https://mustache.github.io/|Mustache] syntax instead of
             previously used [https://golang.org/pkg/html/template/|Go
             template] syntax. This allows these zettel to be used, even when
             there is another Zettelstore implementation, in another
             programming language. Mustache is available for approx. 48
             programming languages, instead of only one for Go templates. <b>If
             you modified your templates, you <i>must</i> adapt them to the new
             syntax. Otherwise the WebUI will not work.</b>
  *  (major) Show zettel identifier of folgezettel and precursor zettel in the
             header of a rendered zettel. If a zettel has real backlinks, they
             are shown at the botton of the page (&ldquo;Additional links to
             this zettel&rdquo;).
  *  (minor) All property metadata, even computed metadata is shown in the info
             page of a zettel.
  *  (minor) Rendering of metadata keys <tt>title</tt> and
             <tt>default-title</tt> in info page changed to a full HTML output
             for these Zettelmarkup encoded values.
  *  (minor) Always show the zettel identifier on the zettel detail view.
             Previously, the identifier was not shown if the zettel was not
             editable.
  *  (minor) Do not show computed metadata in edit forms anymore.

<h2>Changes for Version 0.0.8 (2020-12-23)</h2>
<h3>Server / API</h3>
  *  (bug) Zettel files with extension <tt>.jpg</tt> and without metadata will
           get a <tt>syntax</tt> value &ldquo;jpg&rdquo;. The internal data
           structure got the same value internally, instead of
           &ldquo;jpeg&rdquo;. This has been fixed for all possible alternative
           syntax values.
  *  (bug) If a file, e.g. an image file like <tt>20201130190200.jpg</tt>, is
           added to the directory box, its metadata are just calculated from
           the information available. Updated metadata did not find its way
           into the zettel box, because the <tt>.meta</tt> file was not
           written.
  *  (bug) If just the <tt>.meta</tt> file was deleted manually, the zettel was
           assumed to be missing. A workaround is to restart the software. If
           the <tt>.meta</tt> file is deleted, metadata is now calculated in
           the same way when the <tt>.meta</tt> file is non-existing at the
           start of the software.
  *  (bug) A link to the current zettel, only using a fragment (e.g.
           <code>&#91;&#91;Title|#title]]</code>) is now handled correctly as
           a zettel link (and not as a link to external material).
  *  (minor) Allow zettel to be marked as &ldquo;read only&rdquo;.
             This is done through the metadata key <tt>read-only</tt>.
  *  (bug) When renaming a zettel, check all boxes for the new zettel
           identifier, not just the first one. Otherwise it will be possible to
           shadow a read-only zettel from a next box, effectively modifying it.
  *  (minor) Add support for a configurable default value for metadata key
             <tt>visibility</tt>.
  *  (bug) If <tt>list-page-size</tt> is set to a relatively small value and
           the authenticated user is <i>not</i> the owner, some zettel were not
           shown in the list of zettel or were not returned by the API.
  *  (minor) Add support for new visibility &ldquo;expert&rdquo;.
             An owner becomes an expert, if the runtime configuration key
             <tt>expert-mode</tt> is set to true.
  *  (major) Add support for computed zettel.
             These zettel have an identifier less than <tt>0000000000100</tt>.
             Most of them are only visible, if <tt>expert-mode</tt> is enabled.
  *  (bug)   Fixes a memory leak that results in too many open files after
             approx. 125 reload operations.
  *  (major) Predefined templates for new zettel got an explicit value for
             visibility: &ldquo;login&rdquo;. Please update these zettel if you
             modified them.
  *  (major) Rename key <tt>readonly</tt> of <i>Zettelstore Startup
             Configuration</i> to <tt>read-only-mode</tt>. This was done to
             avoid some confusion with the the zettel metadata key
             <tt>read-only</tt>. <b>Please adapt your startup configuration.
             Otherwise your Zettelstore will be accidentally writable.</b>
  *  (minor) References starting with &ldquo;./&rdquo; and &ldquo;../&rdquo;
             are treated as a local reference. Previously, only the prefix
             &ldquo;/&rdquo; was treated as a local reference.
  *  (major) Metadata key <tt>modified</tt> will be set automatically to the
             current local time if a zettel is updated through Zettelstore.
             <b>If you used that key previously for your own, you should rename
             it before you upgrade.</b>
  *  (minor) The new visibility value &ldquo;simple-expert&rdquo; ensures that
             many computed zettel are shown for new users. This is to enable
             them to send useful bug reports.
  *  (minor) When a zettel is stored as a file, its identifier is additionally
             stored within the metadata. This helps for better robustness in
             case the file names were corrupted. In addition, there could be
             a tool that compares the identifier with the file name.

<h3>WebUI</h3>
  *  (minor) Remove list of tags in &ldquo;List Zettel&rdquo; and search
             results. There was some feedback that the additional tags were not
             helpful.
  *  (minor) Move zettel field "role" above "tags" and move "syntax" more to
             "content".
  *  (minor) Rename zettel operation &ldquo;clone&rdquo; to &ldquo;copy&rdquo;.
  *  (major) All predefined HTML templates have now a visibility value
             &ldquo;expert&rdquo;. If you want to see them as an non-expert
             owner, you must temporary enable <tt>expert-mode</tt> and change
             the <tt>visibility</tt> metadata value.
  *  (minor) Initial support for
             [https://zettelkasten.de/posts/tags/folgezettel/|Folgezettel]. If
             you click on &ldquo;Folge&rdquo; (detail view or info view), a new
             zettel is created with a reference (<tt>precursor</tt>) to the
             original zettel. Title, role, tags, and syntax are copied from the
             original zettel.
  *  (major) Most predefined zettel have a title prefix of
             &ldquo;Zettelstore&rdquo;.
  *  (minor) If started in simple mode, e.g. via double click or without any
             command, some information for the new user is presented. In the
             terminal, there is a hint about opening the web browser and use
             a specific URL. A <i>Welcome zettel</i> is created, to give some
             more information. (This change also applies to the server itself,
             but it is more suited to the WebUI user.)

<a name="0_0_7"></a>
<h2>Changes for Version 0.0.7 (2020-11-24)</h2>
  *  With this version, Zettelstore and this manual got a new license, the
     [https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/eupl|European Union Public
     Licence] (EUPL), version 1.2 or later. Nothing else changed. If you want
     to stay with the old licenses (AGPLv3+, CC BY-SA 4.0), you are free to
     fork from the previous version.

<a name="0_0_6"></a>
<h2>Changes for Version 0.0.6 (2020-11-23)</h2>
<h3>Server</h3>
  *  (major) Rename identifier of <i>Zettelstore Runtime Configuration</i> to
             <tt>00000000000100</tt> (previously <tt>00000000000001</tt>). This
             is done to gain some free identifier with smaller number to be
             used internally. <b>If you customized this zettel, please make
             sure to rename it to the new identifier.</b>
  *  (major) Rename the two essential metadata keys of a user zettel to
             <tt>credential</tt> and <tt>user-id</tt>. The previous values were
             <tt>cred</tt> and <tt>ident</tt>. <b>If you enabled user
             authentication and added some user zettel, make sure to change
             them accordingly. Otherwise these users will not authenticated any
             more.</b>
  *  (minor) Rename the scheme of the box URL where predefined zettel are
             stored to &ldquo;const&rdquo;. The previous value was
             &ldquo;globals&rdquo;.

<h3>Zettelmarkup</h3>
  *  (bug) Allow to specify a <i>fragment</i> in a reference to a zettel.
           Used to link to an internal position within a zettel.
           This applies to CommonMark too.

<h3>API</h3>
  *  (bug)   Encoding binary content in format &ldquo;json&rdquo; now results
             in valid JSON content.
  *  (bug)   All query parameter of filtering a list must be true, regardless
             if a specific key occurs more than one or not.
  *  (minor) Encode all inherited meta values in all formats except
             &ldquo;raw&rdquo;. A meta value is called <i>inherited</i> if
             there is a key starting with <tt>default-</tt> in the
             <i>Zettelstore Runtime Configuration</i>. Applies to WebUI also.
  *  (minor) Automatic calculated identifier for headings (only for
             &ldquo;html&rdquo;, &ldquo;djson&rdquo;, &ldquo;native&rdquo;
             format and for the Web user interface). You can use this to
             provide a zettel reference that links to the heading, without
             specifying an explicit mark (<code>&#91;!mark]</code>).
  *  (major) Allow to retrieve all references of a given zettel.

<h3>Web user interface (WebUI)</h3>
  *  (minor) Focus on the first text field on some forms (new zettel, edit
             zettel, rename zettel, login)
  *  (major) Adapt all HTML templates to a simpler structure.
  *  (bug)   Rendered wrong URLs for internal links on info page.
  *  (bug)   If a zettel contains binary content it cannot be cloned.
             For such a zettel only the metadata can be changed.
  *  (minor) Non-zettel references that neither have an URL scheme, user info,
             nor host name, are considered &ldquo;local references&rdquo; (in
             contrast to &ldquo;zettel references&rdquo; and &ldquo;external
             references&rdquo;). When a local reference is displayed as an URL
             on the WebUI, it will not opened in a new window/tab. They will
             receive a <i>local</i> marker, when encoded as &ldquo;djson&rdquo;
             or &ldquo;native&rdquo;. Local references are listed on the
             <i>Info page</i> of each zettel.
  *  (minor) Change the default value for some visual sugar putd after an
             external URL to <tt>&\#8599;&\#xfe0e;</tt>
             (&ldquo;&#8599;&#xfe0e;&rdquo;). This affects the former key
             <tt>icon-material</tt> of the <i>Zettelstore Runtime
             Configuration</i>, which is renamed to <tt>marker-external</tt>.
  *  (major) Allow multiple zettel to act as templates for creating new zettel.
             All zettel with a role value &ldquo;new-template&rdquo; act as
             a template to create a new zettel. The WebUI menu item
             &ldquo;New&rdquo; changed to a drop-down list with all those
             zettel, ordered by their identifier. All metadata keys with the
             prefix <tt>new-</tt> will be translated to a new or updated
             keys/value without that prefix. You can use this mechanism to
             specify a role for the new zettel, or a different title. The title
             of the template zettel is used in the drop-down list. The initial
             template zettel &ldquo;New Zettel&rdquo; has now a different
             zettel identifier (now: <tt>00000000091001</tt>, was:
             <tt>00000000040001</tt>). <b>Please update it, if you changed that
             zettel.</b>
             <br>Note: this feature was superseded in [#0_0_10|version 0.0.10]
             by the &ldquo;New Menu&rdquo; zettel.
  *  (minor) When a page should be opened in a new windows (e.g. for external
             references), the web browser is instructed to decouple the new
             page from the previous one for privacy and security reasons. In
             detail, the web browser is instructed to omit referrer information
             and to omit a JS object linking to the page that contained the
             external link.
  *  (minor) If the value of the <i>Zettelstore Runtime Configuration</i> key
             <tt>list-page-size</tt> is greater than zero, the number of WebUI
             list elements will be restricted and it is possible to change to
             the next/previous page to list more elements.
  *  (minor) Change CSS to enhance reading: make <code>line-height</code>
             a little smaller (previous: 1.6, now 1.4) and move list items to
             the left.

<h2>Changes for Version 0.0.5 (2020-10-22)</h2>
  *  Application Programming Interface (API) to allow external software to
     retrieve zettel data from the Zettelstore.
  *  Specify boxes, where zettel are stored, via an URL.
  *  Add support for a custom footer.

<a name="0_0_4"></a>
<h2>Changes for Version 0.0.4 (2020-09-11)</h2>
  *  Optional user authentication/authorization.
  *  New sub-commands <tt>file</tt> (use Zettelstore as a command line filter),
     <tt>password</tt> (for authentication), and <tt>config</tt>.

<a name="0_0_3"></a>
<h2>Changes for Version 0.0.3 (2020-08-31)</h2>
  *  Starting Zettelstore has been changed by introducing sub-commands.
     This change is also reflected on the server installation procedures.
  *  Limitations on renaming zettel has been relaxed.

<a name="0_0_2"></a>
<h2>Changes for Version 0.0.2 (2020-08-28)</h2>
  *  Configuration zettel now has ID <tt>00000000000001</tt> (previously:
     <tt>00000000000000</tt>).
  *  The zettel with ID <tt>00000000000000</tt> is no longer shown in any
     zettel list. If you changed the configuration zettel, you should rename it
     manually in its file directory.
  *  Creating a new zettel is now done by cloning an existing zettel.
     To mimic the previous behaviour, a zettel with ID <tt>00000000040001</tt>
     is introduced. You can change it if you need a different template zettel.
