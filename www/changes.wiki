<h2>Changes for Version 0.0.10 (pending)</h2>
  *  Menu item &ldquo;Home&rdquo; now redirects to a home zettel.
     Its default identifier is <tt>000100000000</tt>.
     The identifier can be changed with configuration key <tt>home-zettel</tt>, which supersedes key <tt>start</tt>.
     The default home zettel contains some welcoming information for the new user.
     (major: webui)
  *  Show context of a zettel by following all backward and/or forward reference
     up to a defined depth and list the resulting zettel. Additionally, some zettel
     with similar tags as the initial zettel are also taken into account.
     (major: api, webui)
  *  A zettel that references other zettel within first-level list items, can act
     as a &ldquo;table of contents&rdquo; zettel.
     The API endpoint <tt>/o/{ID}</tt> allows to retrieve the referenced zettel in
     the same order as they occur in the zettel.
     (major: api)
  *  The zettel &ldquo;New Menu&rdquo; with identifier <tt>00000000090000</tt> contains
     a list of all zettel that should act as a template for new zettel.
     They are listed in the WebUIs &rdquo;New&ldquo; menu.
     This is an application of the previous item.
     It supersedes the usage of a role <tt>new-template</tt> introduced in [#0_0_6|version 0.0.6].
     <b>Please update your zettel if you make use of the now deprecated feature.</b>
     (major: webui)
  *  A reference that starts with two slash characters (&ldquo;<code>//</code>&rdquo;)
     it will be interpreted relative to the value of <code>url-prefix</code>.
     For example, if <code>url-prefix</code> has the value <code>/manual/</code>,
     the reference <code>&lbrack;&lbrack;Zettel list|//h]]</code> will render as
     <code>&lt;a href="/manual/h">Zettel list&lt;/a></code>. (minor: syntax)
  *  Searching/filtering ignores the leading '#' character of tags.
     (minor: api, webui)
  *  When result of filtering or searching is presented, the query is written as the page heading.
     (minor: webui)
  *  A reference to a zettel that contains a URL fragment, will now be processed by the indexer.
     (bug: server)
  *  Runtime configuration key <tt>marker-external</tt> now defaults to
     &ldquo;&amp;#10138;&rdquo; (&ldquo;&#10138;&rdquo;). It is more beautiful
     than the previous &ldquo;&amp;#8599;&amp;#xfe0e;&rdquo;
     (&ldquo;&#8599;&#65038;&rdquo;), which also needed the additional
     &ldquo;&amp;#xfe0e;&rdquo; to disable the conversion to an emoji on iPadOS.
     (minor: webui)
  *  A pre-build binary for macOS ARM64 (also known as Apple silicon) is available.
     (minor: infrastructure)
  *  Many smaller bug fixes and inprovements, to the software and to the documentation.

<h2>Changes for Version 0.0.9 (2021-01-29)</h2>
This is the first version that is managed by [https://fossil-scm.org|Fossil] instead
of GitHub. To access older versions, use the Git repository under
[https://github.com/zettelstore/zettelstore-github|zettelstore-github].

<h3>Server / API</h3>
  *  (major) Support for property metadata.
             Metadata key <tt>published</tt> is the first example of such a property.
  *  (major) A background activity (called <i>indexer</i>) continuously monitors
             zettel changes to establish the reverse direction of found internal links.
             This affects the new metadata keys <tt>precursor</tt> and <tt>folge</tt>.
             A user specifies the precursor of a zettel and the indexer computes the
             property metadata for [https://forum.zettelkasten.de/discussion/996/definition-folgezettel|Folgezettel].
             Metadata keys with type &ldquo;Identifier&rdquo; or &ldquo;IdentifierSet&rdquo;
             that have no inverse key (like <tt>precursor</tt> and <tt>folge</tt>
             with add to the key <tt>forward</tt> that also collects all internal
             links within the content. The computed inverse is <tt>backward</tt>, which provides all backlinks.
             The key <tt>back</tt> is computed as the value of <tt>backward</tt>, but without forward links.
             Therefore, <tt>back</tt> is something like the list of &ldquo;smart backlinks&rdquo;.
  *  (minor) If Zettelstore is being stopped, an appropriate message is written in the console log.
  *  (minor) New computed zettel with environmental data, the list of supported meta data keys,
             and statistics about all configured zettel places.
             Some other computed zettel got a new identifier (to make room for other variant).
  *  (minor) Remove zettel <tt>00000000000004</tt>, which contained the Go version that produced the Zettelstore executable.
             It was too specific to the current implementation.
             This information is now included in zettel <tt>00000000000006</tt> (<i>Zettelstore Environment Values</i>).
  *  (minor) Predefined templates for new zettel do not contain any value for attribute <tt>visibility</tt> any more.
  *  (minor) Add a new metadata key type called &ldquo;Zettelmarkup&rdquo;.
             It is a non-empty string, that will be formatted with Zettelmarkup.
             <tt>title</tt> and <tt>default-title</tt> have this type.
  *  (major) Rename zettel syntax &ldquo;meta&rdquo; to &ldquo;none&rdquo;.
             Please update the <i>Zettelstore Runtime Configuration</i> and all other zettel that previously used the value &ldquo;meta&rdquo;.
             Other zettel are typically user zettel, used for authentication.
             However, there is no real harm, if you do not update these zettel.
             In this case, the metadata is just not presented when rendered.
             Zettelstore will still work.
  *  (minor) Login will take at least 500 milliseconds to mitigate login attacks.
             This affects both the API and the WebUI.
  *  (minor) Add a sort option &ldquo;_random&rdquo; to produce a zettel list in random order.
             <tt>_order</tt> / <tt>order</tt> are now an aliases for the query parameters <tt>_sort</tt> / <tt>sort</tt>.

<h3>WebUI</h3>
  *  (major) HTML template zettel for WebUI now use [https://mustache.github.io/|Mustache]
             syntax instead of previously used [https://golang.org/pkg/html/template/|Go template] syntax.
             This allows these zettel to be used, even when there is another Zettelstore implementation, in another programming language.
             Mustache is available for approx. 48 programming languages, instead of only one for Go templates.
             <b>If you modified your templates, you <i>must</i> adapt them to the new syntax.
             Otherwise the WebUI will not work.</b>
  *  (major) Show zettel identifier of folgezettel and precursor zettel in the header of a rendered zettel.
             If a zettel has backlinks, they are shown at the botton of the page
             (&ldquo;Links to this zettel&rdquo;).
  *  (minor) All property metadata, even computed metadata is shown in the info page of a zettel.
  *  (minor) Rendering of metadata keys <tt>title</tt> and <tt>default-title</tt> in info page changed to a full HTML output for these Zettelmarkup encoded values.
  *  (minor) Always show the zettel identifier on the zettel detail view.
             Previously, the identifier was not shown if the zettel was not editable.
  *  (minor) Do not show computed metadata in edit forms anymore.

<h2>Changes for Version 0.0.8 (2020-12-23)</h2>
<h3>Server / API</h3>
  *  (bug) Zettel files with extension <tt>.jpg</tt> and without metadata will get a <tt>syntax</tt> value &ldquo;jpg&rdquo;.
           The internal data structure got the same value internally, instead of &ldquo;jpeg&rdquo;.
           This has been fixed for all possible alternative syntax values.
  *  (bug) If a file, e.g. an image file like <tt>20201130190200.jpg</tt>, is added to the directory place,
  *        its metadata are just calculated from the information available.
           Updated metadata did not find its way into the place, because the <tt>.meta</tt> file was not written.
           This has been fixed.
  *  (bug) If just the <tt>.meta</tt> file was deleted manually, the zettel was assumed to be missing.
           A workaround is to restart the software.
           This has been fixed.
           If the <tt>.meta</tt> file is deleted, metadata is now calculated in the same way when the <tt>.meta</tt> file is non-existing at the start of the software.
  *  (bug) A link to the current zettel, only using a fragment (e.g. <code>&#91;&#91;Title|#title]]</code>) is now handled correctly as a zettel link (and not as a link to external material).
  *  (minor) Allow zettel to be marked as &ldquo;read only&rdquo;.
             This is done through the metadata key <tt>read-only</tt>.
  *  (bug) When renaming a zettel, check all places for the new zettel identifier, not just the first place.
           Otherwise it will be possible to shadow a read-only zettel from a next place, effectively modifying it.
  *  (minor) Add support for a configurable default value for metadata key <tt>visibility</tt>.
  *  (bug) If <tt>list-page-size</tt> is set to a relatively small value and the authenticated user is <i>not</i> the owner,
  *        some zettel were not shown in the list of zettel or were not returned by the API.
  *  (minor) Add support for new visibility &ldquo;expert&rdquo;.
             An owner becomes an expert, if the runtime configuration key <tt>expert-mode</tt> is set to true.
  *  (major) Add support for computed zettel.
             These zettel have an identifier less than <tt>0000000000100</tt>.
             Most of them are only visible, if <tt>expert-mode</tt> is enabled.
  *  (bug) Fixes a memory leak that results in too many open files after approx. 125 reload operations.
  *  (major) Predefined templates for new zettel got an explicit value for visibility: &ldquo;login&rdquo;.
             Please update these zettel if you modified them.
  *  (major) Rename key <tt>readonly</tt> of <i>Zettelstore Startup Configuration</i> to <tt>read-only-mode</tt>.
             This was done to avoid some confusion with the the zettel metadata key <tt>read-only</tt>.
             <b>Please adapt your startup configuration.
             Otherwise your Zettelstore will be accidentally writable.</b>
  *  (minor) References starting with &ldquo;./&rdquo; and &ldquo;../&rdquo; are treated as a local reference.
             Previously, only the prefix &ldquo;/&rdquo; was treated as a local reference.
  *  (major) Metadata key <tt>modified</tt> will be set automatically to the current local time if a zettel is updated through Zettelstore.
             <b>If you used that key previously for your own, you should rename it before you upgrade.</b>
  *  (minor) The new visibility value &ldquo;simple-expert&rdquo; ensures that many computed zettel are shown for new users.
             This is to enable them to send useful bug reports.
  *  (minor) When a zettel is stored as a file, its identifier is additionally stored within the metadata.
             This helps for better robustness in case the file names were corrupted.
             In addition, there could be a tool that compares the identifier with the file name.

<h3>WebUI</h3>
  *  (minor) Remove list of tags in &ldquo;List Zettel&rdquo; and search results.
             There was some feedback that the additional tags were not helpful.
  *  (minor) Move zettel field "role" above "tags" and move "syntax" more to "content".
  *  (minor) Rename zettel operation &ldquo;clone&rdquo; to &ldquo;copy&rdquo;.
  *  (major) All predefined HTML templates have now a visibility value &ldquo;expert&rdquo;.
             If you want to see them as an non-expert owner, you must temporary enable <tt>expert-mode</tt> and change the <tt>visibility</tt> metadata value.
  *  (minor) Initial support for [https://zettelkasten.de/posts/tags/folgezettel/|Folgezettel].
             If you click on &ldquo;Folge&rdquo; (detail view or info view), a new zettel is created with a reference (<tt>precursor</tt>) to the original zettel.
             Title, role, tags, and syntax are copied from the original zettel.
  *  (major) Most predefined zettel have a title prefix of &ldquo;Zettelstore&rdquo;.
  *  (minor) If started in simple mode, e.g. via double click or without any command, some information for the new user is presented.
             In the terminal, there is a hint about opening the web browser and use a specific URL.
             A <i>Welcome zettel</i> is created, to give some more information.
             (This change also applies to the server itself, but it is more suited to the WebUI user.)

<a name="0_0_7"></a>
<h2>Changes for Version 0.0.7 (2020-11-24)</h2>
  *  With this version, Zettelstore and this manual got a new license, the
     [https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/eupl|European Union Public Licence] (EUPL), version 1.2 or later.
     Nothing else changed.
     If you want to stay with the old licenses (AGPLv3+, CC BY-SA 4.0),
     you are free to fork from the previous version.

<a name="0_0_6"></a>
<h2>Changes for Version 0.0.6 (2020-11-23)</h2>
<h3>Server</h3>
  *  (major) Rename identifier of <i>Zettelstore Runtime Configuration</i> to <tt>00000000000100</tt> (previously <tt>00000000000001</tt>).
             This is done to gain some free identifier with smaller number to be used internally.
             <b>If you customized this zettel, please make sure to rename it to the new identifier.</b>
  *  (major) Rename the two essential metadata keys of a user zettel to <tt>credential</tt> and <tt>user-id</tt>.
             The previous values were <tt>cred</tt> and <tt>ident</tt>.
             <b>If you enabled user authentication and added some user zettel, make sure to change them accordingly.
             Otherwise these users will not authenticated any more.</b>
  *  (minor) Rename the scheme of the place URL where predefined zettel are stored to &ldquo;const&rdquo;.
             The previous value was &ldquo;globals&rdquo;.

<h3>Zettelmarkup</h3>
  *  (bug) Allow to specify a <i>fragment</i> in a reference to a zettel.
           Used to link to an internal position within a zettel.
           This applies to CommonMark too.

<h3>API</h3>
  *  (bug) Encoding binary content in format &ldquo;json&rdquo; now results in valid JSON content.
  *  (bug) All query parameter of filtering a list must be true, regardless if a specific key occurs more than one or not.
  *  (minor) Encode all inherited meta values in all formats except &ldquo;raw&rdquo;.
             A meta value is called <i>inherited</i> if there is a key starting with <tt>default-</tt> in the <i>Zettelstore Runtime Configuration</i>.
             Applies to WebUI also.
  *  (minor) Automatic calculated identifier for headings (only for &ldquo;html&rdquo;, &ldquo;djson&rdquo;, &ldquo;native&rdquo; format and for the Web user interface).
             You can use this to provide a zettel reference that links to the heading, without specifying an explicit mark (<code>&#91;!mark]</code>).
  *  (major) Allow to retrieve all references of a given zettel.

<h3>Web user interface (WebUI)</h3>
  *  (minor) Focus on the first text field on some forms (new zettel, edit zettel, rename zettel, login)
  *  (major) Adapt all HTML templates to a simpler structure.
  *  (bug) Rendered wrong URLs for internal links on info page.
  *  (bug) If a zettel contains binary content it cannot be cloned.
           For such a zettel only the metadata can be changed.
  *  (minor) Non-zettel references that neither have an URL scheme, user info, nor host name,
             are considered &ldquo;local references&rdquo; (in contrast to &ldquo;zettel references&rdquo; and &ldquo;external references&rdquo;).
             When a local reference is displayed as an URL on the WebUI, it will not opened in a new window/tab.
             They will receive a <i>local</i> marker, when encoded as &ldquo;djson&rdquo; or &ldquo;native&rdquo;.
             Local references are listed on the <i>Info page</i> of each zettel.
  *  (minor) Change the default value for some visual sugar placed after an external URL to <tt>&\#8599;&\#xfe0e;</tt> (&ldquo;&#8599;&#xfe0e;&rdquo;).
             This affects the former key <tt>icon-material</tt> of the <i>Zettelstore Runtime Configuration</i>, which is renamed to <tt>marker-external</tt>.
  *  (major) Allow multiple zettel to act as templates for creating new zettel.
             All zettel with a role value &ldquo;new-template&rdquo; act as a template to create a new zettel.
             The WebUI menu item &ldquo;New&rdquo; changed to a drop-down list with all those zettel, ordered by their identifier.
             All metadata keys with the prefix <tt>new-</tt> will be translated to a new or updated keys/value without that prefix.
             You can use this mechanism to specify a role for the new zettel, or a different title.
             The title of the template zettel is used in the drop-down list.
             The initial template zettel &ldquo;New Zettel&rdquo; has now a different zettel identifier
             (now: <tt>00000000091001</tt>, was: <tt>00000000040001</tt>).
             <b>Please update it, if you changed that zettel.</b>
             <br>Note: this feature was superseded in [#0_0_10|version 0.0.10] by the &ldquo;New Menu&rdquo; zettel.
  *  (minor) When a page should be opened in a new windows (e.g. for external references),
             the web browser is instructed to decouple the new page from the previous one for privacy and security reasons.
             In detail, the web browser is instructed to omit referrer information and to omit a JS object linking to the page that contained the external link.
  *  (minor) If the value of the <i>Zettelstore Runtime Configuration</i> key <tt>list-page-size</tt> is greater than zero,
             the number of WebUI list elements will be restricted and it is possible to change to the next/previous page to list more elements.
  *  (minor) Change CSS to enhance reading: make <code>line-height</code> a little smaller (previous: 1.6, now 1.4) and move list items to the left.

<a name="0_0_5"></a>
<h2>Changes for Version 0.0.5 (2020-10-22)</h2>
  *  Application Programming Interface (API) to allow external software to retrieve zettel data from the Zettelstore.
  *  Specify places, where zettel are stored, via an URL.
  *  Add support for a custom footer.

<a name="0_0_4"></a>
<h2>Changes for Version 0.0.4 (2020-09-11)</h2>
  *  Optional user authentication/authorization.
  *  New sub-commands <tt>file</tt> (use Zettelstore as a command line filter), <tt>password</tt> (for authentication), and <tt>config</tt>.

<a name="0_0_3"></a>
<h2>Changes for Version 0.0.3 (2020-08-31)</h2>
  *  Starting Zettelstore has been changed by introducing sub-commands.
     This change is also reflected on the server installation procedures.
  *  Limitations on renaming zettel has been relaxed.

<a name="0_0_2"></a>
<h2>Changes for Version 0.0.2 (2020-08-28)</h2>
  *  Configuration zettel now has ID <tt>00000000000001</tt> (previously: <tt>00000000000000</tt>).
  *  The zettel with ID <tt>00000000000000</tt> is no longer shown in any zettel list.
     If you changed the configuration zettel, you should rename it manually in its file directory.
  *  Creating a new zettel is now done by cloning an existing zettel.
     To mimic the previous behaviour, a zettel with ID <tt>00000000040001</tt> is introduced.
     You can change it if you need a different template zettel.

<a name="0_0_1"></a>
<h2>Changes for Version 0.0.1 (2020-08-21)</h2>
  *  Initial public release.
