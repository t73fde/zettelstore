# How to build Zettelstore
## Prerequisites
You must install the following software:

* A current, supported [release of Go](https://go.dev/doc/devel/release),
* [staticcheck](https://staticcheck.io/),
* [shadow](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis/passes/shadow),
* [unparam](https://mvdan.cc/unparam),
* [govulncheck](https://golang.org/x/vuln/cmd/govulncheck),
* [Fossil](https://fossil-scm.org/),
* [Git](https://git-scm.org) (so that Go can download some dependencies).

See folder `docs/development` (a zettel box) for details.

## Clone the repository
Most of this is covered by the excellent Fossil
[documentation](https://fossil-scm.org/home/doc/trunk/www/quickstart.wiki).

1. Create a directory to store your Fossil repositories.
   Let's assume, you have created `$HOME/fossils`.
1. Clone the repository: `fossil clone https://zettelstore.de/ $HOME/fossils/zettelstore.fossil`.
1. Create a working directory.
   Let's assume, you have created `$HOME/zettelstore`.
1. Change into this directory: `cd $HOME/zettelstore`.
1. Open development: `fossil open $HOME/fossils/zettelstore.fossil`.

## Tools to build, test, and manage
In the directory `tools` there are some Go files to automate most aspects of
building and testing, (hopefully) platform-independent.

The build script is called as:

```
go run tools/build/build.go [-v] COMMAND
```

The flag `-v` enables the verbose mode.
It outputs all commands called by the tool.

Some important `COMMAND`s are:

* `build`: builds the software with correct version information and puts it
  into a freshly created directory `bin`.
* `check`: checks the current state of the working directory to be ready for
  release (or commit).
* `version`: prints the current version information.

Therefore, the easiest way to build your own version of the Zettelstore
software is to execute the command

```
go run tools/build/build.go build
```

In case of errors, please send the output of the verbose execution:

```
go run tools/build/build.go -v build
```

Other tools are:

* `go run tools/clean/clean.go` cleans your Go development worspace.
* `go run tools/check/check.go` executes all linters and unit tests.
  If you add the option `-r` linters are more strict, to be used for a
  release version.
* `go run tools/devtools/devtools.go` install all needed software (see above).
* `go run tools/htmllint/htmllint.go [URL]` checks all generated HTML of a
  Zettelstore accessible at the given URL (default: http://localhost:23123).
* `go run tools/testapi/testapi.go` tests the API against a running
  Zettelstore, which is started automatically.

## A note on the use of Fossil
Zettelstore is managed by the Fossil version control system.
Fossil is an alternative to the ubiquitous Git version control system.
However, Go seems to prefer Git and popular platforms that just support Git.

Some dependencies of Zettelstore, namely [Zettelstore
client](https://zettelstore.de/client) and [sx](https://zettelstore.de/sx), are
also managed by Fossil.
Depending on your development setup, some error messages might occur.

If the error message mentions an environment variable called `GOVCS` you should
set it to the value `GOVCS=zettelstore.de:fossil` (alternatively more generous
to `GOVCS=*:all`).
Since the Go build system is coupled with Git and some special platforms, you
allow ot to download a Fossil repository from the host `zettelstore.de`.
The build tool set `GOVCS` to the right value, but you may use other `go`
commands that try to download a Fossil repository.

On some operating systems, namely Termux on Android, an error message might
state that an user cannot be determined (`cannot determine user`).
In this case, Fossil is allowed to download the repository, but cannot
associate it with an user name.
Set the environment variable `USER` to any user name, like:
`USER=nobody go run tools/build.go build`.
