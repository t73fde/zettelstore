This is a fork of gopikchr/gopikchr, adapted to the needs of Zettelstore.

File gopikchr.go is generated by gopikchr.y
You should not modify gopikchr.go, only gopikchr.Y

To generate gopikchr.go you have to install gopikchr/golemon first:

    go install github.com/gopikchr/golemon@latest

Invoke golemon:

    golemon gopikchr.y

This will produce the files gopikchr.go and gopikchr.out
You can safely remove gopikchr.out

You probably should reformat the generated go file:

    gofmt -w gopikchr.go

In the future, golemon might be incorporated too, to make generation easier and more self-hosted.
