Zettelstore
===========

Zettelstore is a software that collects and relates your notes ("zettel") to
represent and enhance your knowledge. It helps with many tasks of personal
knowledge management by explicitly supporting the Zettelkasten method (see:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten). The method is based on creating
many individual notes, each with one idea or information, that are related to
each other. Since knowledge is typically build up gradually, one major focus is
a long-term store of these notes, hence the name "Zettelstore".

To get an impression, take a look at the manual at
https://zettelstore.de/manual/. It is a live example of the zettelstore
software, running in read-only mode. You can download it separately and it is
possible to make it directly available for your local Zettelstore.

The software, including the manual, is licensed under the European Union Public
License 1.2 (or later). See the separate file LICENSE.txt.
