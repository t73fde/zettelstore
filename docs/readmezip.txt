Zettelstore
===========

Zettelstore is a software that collects and links your notes ("zettel") to
represent and enhance your knowledge. It assists with various tasks of personal
knowledge management by explicitly supporting the Zettelkasten method (see:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten). The method is based on creating
many individual notes, each with one idea or piece of information, which are
related to each other. Since knowledge is typically built up gradually, one
of the main focuses is the long-term storage of these notes, hence the name
"Zettelstore".

To get an initial impression, take a look at the manual
(https://zettelstore.de/manual/). It serves as a live example of the
Zettelstore software, running in read-only mode. You can download it
separately, and it is possible to make it directly available for your local
Zettelstore.

The software, including the manual, is licensed under the European Union Public
License 1.2 (or later). See the separate LICENSE.txt file for more details.
