A zettel representation as it was loaded from the zettel content.

Often used to have access to the bytes of an image.

If transferred via HTTP, the content type will depend on various factors:

* If the whole zettel should be transferred and it contains textual data only, ''text/plain'' will be used.
Otherwise the content type of the whole zettel will be ''application/octet-stream''.
* If just metadata is transferred, ''text/plain'' will be used.
* If just the content has to be transferred, the content type depends on the actual dats.
  A PNG image will be transferred as ''image/png'', HTML content as ''text/html'', and so on.
