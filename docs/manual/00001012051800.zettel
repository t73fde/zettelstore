In most cases, it is not essential to list //all// zettel.
Typically, you are interested only in a subset of the zettel maintained by your Zettelstore.
This is done by adding some query parameters to the general ''GET /j'' request.

* [[Select|00001012051810]] just some zettel, based on metadata.
* Only a specific amount of zettel will be selected by specifying [[a length and/or an offset|00001012051830]].
* [[Searching for specific content|00001012051840]], not just the metadata, is another way of selecting some zettel.
* The resulting list can be [[sorted|00001012052000]] according to various criteria.
