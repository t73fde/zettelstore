The [[endpoint|00001012920000]] ''/x'' allows you to execute some (administrative) commands.
To differentiate between the possible commands, you have to set the query parameter ''_cmd'' to a specific value:

; ''refresh''
: [[Refresh internal data|00001012080500]]

Other commands will be defined in the future.
