Values of this type are [[String|00001006033500]] values, interpreted as [[Zettelmarkup|00001007000000]].

=== Allowed values
All printable characters are allowed.
There must be at least one such character.

=== Query operator
Comparison is done similar to the full-text search: both the value to compare and the metadata value are normalized according to Unicode NKFD, ignoring everything except letters and numbers.
Letters are mapped to the corresponding lower-case value.

For example, ""Br√ºcke"" will be the prefix of ""(Bruckenpfeiler,"".

=== Sorting
To sort two values, the underlying encoding is used to determine which value is less than the other.

Uppercase letters are typically interpreted as less than their corresponding lowercase letters, i.e. ``A < a``.

Comparison is done character-wise by finding the first difference in the respective character sequence.
For example, ``abc > aBc``.
