Values of this type are [[String|00001006033500]] values, interpreted as [[Zettelmarkup|00001007000000]].

=== Allowed values
All printable characters are allowed.
There must be at least one such character.

=== Match operator
A value matches a String value, if the first value is part of the String value.
This check is done case-insensitive.

For example, ""hell"" matches ""Hello"".

=== Sorting
To sort two values, the underlying encoding is used to determine which value is less than the other.

Uppercase letters are typically interpreted as less than their corresponding lowercase letters, i.e. ``A < a``.

Comparison is done character-wise by finding the first difference in the respective character sequence.
For example, ``abc > aBc``.
