Since Zettelstore does not encrypt the messages it exchanges with its clients, you may need some additional software to enable encryption.

=== Public-key encryption
To enable encryption, you probably use some kind of encryption keys.
In most cases, you need to deploy a ""public-key encryption"" process, where your side publishes a public encryption key that only works with a corresponding private decryption key.
Technically, this is not trivial.
Any client who wants to communicate with your Zettelstore must trust the public encryption key.
Otherwise the client cannot be sure that it is communicating with your Zettelstore.
This problem is solved in part with [[Let's Encrypt|https://letsencrypt.org/]],
""a free, automated, and open certificate authority (CA), run for the public’s benefit.
It is a service provided by the [[Internet Security Research Group|https://www.abetterinternet.org/]]"".

Alternatively, you can buy these keys for public-key encryption at ""certificate authorities"" or its dealers.

=== Server software for encryption
The solution of placing a server for encryption in front of an encryption-unaware server is a relatively old one.
There are many different alternatives to choose.

First, there are web servers.
Business-grade web servers must enable encryption.
Most of them allow forwarding requests without encryption to another web server.
Some examples:

* [[Apache Web Server|https://httpd.apache.org/]]: enable [[mod_proxy|https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_proxy.html]] and configure a reverse proxy.
* [[nginx|https://nginx.org/]]: set-up a reverse proxy with the [[''proxy_pass''|https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_proxy_module.html#proxy_pass]] directive.
* [[Caddy|https://caddyserver.com/]]: see below for details.

Other software is also possible.
There exists software dedicated for this task of handling the encryption part.
Some examples:

* [[stunnel|https://www.stunnel.org/]] (""a proxy designed to add TLS encryption functionality to existing clients and servers without any changes in the programs' code."")
* [[Traefik|https://traefik.io/]]: set-up a [[router|https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/routing/routers/]].

=== Example configuration for Caddy
For the inexperienced owner of a Zettelstore, [[Caddy|https://caddyserver.com/]] is a good option[^In fact, the [[server-based installation procedure|00001003000000]] of Zettelstore was inspired by Caddy.].
Caddy has the capability to automatically fetch appropriately encryption key from Let's Encrypt, without any further configuration.
The only requirement of doing this is that the server must be publicly accessible.

Here is the base configuration for the main site for Zettelstore at [[https://zettelstore.de/]]:
```
zettelstore.de {
  reverse_proxy localhost:23123
}
```
That's all!

If you want to add some additional content on the server, you could change the configuration as follows:
```
zettelstore.de {
  file_server * {
    root /var/www/html
  }
  route /manual/* {
    reverse_proxy localhost:23123
  }
}
```
This will forward requests with the prefix ""/manual/"" to the running Zettelstore.
All other requests will be handled by Caddy itself.

In this case you must specify the [[startup configuration key ''url-prefix''|00001004010000#url-prefix]] with the value ""/manual/"".
This is to allow Zettelstore to ignore the prefix while reading web requests and to give the correct URLs with the given prefix when sending a web response.

=== Cross-origin protection

Zettelstore protects you against [[Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)|https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Attacks/CSRF]].
The protection will work only if the external server forwards certain HTTP request headers to Zettelstore:

* [[''Sec-Fetch-Site''|https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Sec-Fetch-Site]] is read first and should contain the values ""same-origin"" or ""none"".
* [[''Origin''|https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Origin]] is read next, if ''Sec-Fetch-Site'' is either missing or contains other values.
  In this case ''Origin'' should contain the same host name as read via header [[''Host''|https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Host]].

Otherwise, a cross-origin request will be detected.

To debug the configuration of the external server, Zettelstore will log the received header values, if Zettelstore is run with the [[''-debug''|00001004051000#debug]] parameter.
