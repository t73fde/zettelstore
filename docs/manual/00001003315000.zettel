Since there is no such thing as the one Linux, there are too many different ways to automatically start Zettelstore.

* One way is to interpret your Linux desktop system as a server and use the [[recipe to install Zettelstore on a server|00001003600000]].
* If you are using the [[Gnome Desktop|https://www.gnome.org/]], you could use the tool [[Tweak|https://wiki.gnome.org/action/show/Apps/Tweaks]] (formerly known as ""GNOME Tweak Tool"" or just ""Tweak Tool"").
  It allows to specify application that should run on startup / login.
* [[KDE|https://kde.org/]] provides a system setting to [[autostart|https://docs.kde.org/stable5/en/plasma-workspace/kcontrol/autostart/]] applications.
* [[Xfce|https://xfce.org/]] allows to specify [[autostart applications|https://docs.xfce.org/xfce/xfce4-session/preferences#application_autostart]].
* [[LXDE|https://www.lxde.org/]] uses [[LXSession Edit|https://wiki.lxde.org/en/LXSession_Edit]] to allow users to specify autostart applications.

If you use a different desktop environment, it often helps to to provide its name and the string ""autostart"" to google for it with the search engine of your choice.
