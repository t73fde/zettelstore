Values of this type denote a point in time.

=== Allowed values
Must be a sequence of 14 digits (""0""--""9"") (same as an [[Identifier|00001006032000]]), with the restriction that is conforms to the pattern ""YYYYMMDDhhmmss"".

* YYYY is the year,
* MM is the month,
* DD is the day,
* hh is the hour,
* mm is the minute,
* ss is the second.

=== Query comparison
All comparisons assume that up to 14 digits are given.
Comparison is done through the string representation.

=== Sorting
Sorting is done by comparing the [[String|00001006033500]] values.

If both values are timestamp values, this works well because both have the same length.
