=== Welcome Zettel
* **Problem:** You want to put your Zettelstore into the public and need a starting zettel for your users.
  In addition, you still want a ""home zettel"", with all your references to internal, non-public zettel.
  Zettelstore only allows to specify one [[''home-zettel''|00001004020000#home-zettel]].
* **Solution:**
*# Create a new zettel with all your references to internal, non-public zettel.
   Let's assume this zettel receives the zettel identifier ''20220803182600''.
*# Create the zettel that should serve as the starting zettel for your users.
   It must have syntax [[Zettelmarkup|00001008000000#zmk]], i.e. the syntax metadata must be set to ''zmk''.
   If needed, set the runtime configuration [[''home-zettel|00001004020000#home-zettel]] to the value of the identifier of this zettel.
*# At the beginning of the start zettel, add the following [[Zettelmarkup|00001007000000]] text in a separate paragraph: ``{{{20220803182600}}}`` (you have to adapt to the actual value of the zettel identifier for your non-public home zettel).
* **Discussion:** As stated in the description for a [[transclusion|00001007031100]], a transclusion will be ignored, if the transcluded zettel is not visible to the current user.
  In effect, the transclusion statement (above paragraph that contained ''{{{...}}}'') is ignored when rendering the zettel.

=== Role-specific Layout of Zettel in Web User Interface (WebUI)
[!role-css]
* **Problem:** You want to add some CSS when displaying zettel of a specific [[role|00001006020000#role]].
  For example, you might want to add a yellow background color for all [[configuration|00001006020100#configuration]] zettel.
  Or you want a multi-column layout.
* **Solution:** If you enable [[''expert-mode''|00001004020000#expert-mode]], you will have access to a zettel called ""[[Zettelstore Role to CSS Map|00000000029000]]"" (its identifier is ''00000000029000'').
  This zettel maps a role name to a zettel that must contain the role-specific CSS code.

  First, create a zettel containing the needed CSS: give it any title, its role is preferably ""configuration"" (but this is not a must).
  Set its [[''syntax''|00001006020000#syntax]]Â must be set to ""[[css|00001008000000#css]]"".
  The content must contain the role-specific CSS code, for example ``body {background-color: #FFFFD0}``for a background in a light yellow color.

  Let's assume, the newly created CSS zettel got the identifier ''20220825200100''.

  Now, you have to connect this zettel to the zettel called ""Zettelstore Role CSS Map"".
  Since you have enabled ''expert-mode'', you are allowed to modify it.
  Add the following metadata ''css-configuration-zid: 20220825200100'' to assign the role-specific CSS code for the role ""configuration"" to the CSS zettel containing that CSS.

  In general, its role-assigning metadata must be like this pattern: ''css-ROLE-zid: ID'', where ''ROLE'' is the placeholder for the role, and ''ID'' for the zettel identifier containing CSS code.
  It is allowed to assign more than one role to a specific CSS zettel.
* **Discussion:** you have to ensure that the CSS zettel is allowed to be read by the intended audience of the zettel with that given role.
  For example, if you made zettel with a specific role public visible, the CSS zettel must also have a [[''visibility: public''|00001010070200]] metadata.
* **Extension:** if you have already established a role-specific layout for zettel, but you additionally want just one another zettel with another role to be rendered with the same CSS, you have to add metadata to the one zettel: ''css-role: ROLE'', where ''ROLE'' is the placeholder for the role that already is assigned to a specific CSS-based layout.

=== Zettel synchronization with iCloud (Apple)
* **Problem:** You use Zettelstore on various macOS computers and you want to use the sameset of zettel across all computers.
* **Solution:** Place your zettel in an iCloud folder.

  To configure Zettelstore to use the folder, you must specify its location within you directory structure as [[''box-uri-X''|00001004010000#box-uri-x]] (replace ''X'' with an appropriate number).
  Your iCloud folder is typically placed in the folder ''~/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs''.
  The ""''~''"" is a shortcut and specifies your home folder.

  Unfortunately, Zettelstore does not yet support this shortcut.
  Therefore you must replace it with the absolute name of your home folder.
  In addition, a space character is not allowed in an URI.
  You have to replace it with the sequence ""''%20''"".

  Let us assume, that you stored your zettel box inside the folder ""zettel"", which is located top-level in your iCloud folder.
  In this case, you must specify the following box URI within the startup configuration: ''box-uri-1: dir:///Users/USERNAME/Library/Mobile%20Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/zettel'', replacing ''USERNAME'' with the username of that specific computer (and assuming you want to use it as the first box).
* **Solution 2:** If you typically start your Zettelstore on the command line, you could use the ''-d DIR'' option for the [[''run''|00001004051000#d]] sub-command.
  In this case you are allowed to use the character ""''~''"".

  ''zettelstore run -d ~/Library/Mobile\\ Documents/com\\~apple\\~CloudDocs/zettel''

  (The ""''\\''"" is needed by the command line processor to mask the following character to be processed in unintended ways.)
* **Discussion:** Zettel files are synchronized between your computers via iCloud.
  Is does not matter, if one of your computer is offline / switched off.
  iCloud will synchronize the zettel files if it later comes online.

  However, if you use more than one computer simultaneously, you must be aware that synchronization takes some time.
  It might take several seconds, maybe longer, that new new version of a zettel appears on the other computer.
  If you update the same zettel on multiple computers at nearly the same time, iCloud will not be able to synchronize the different versions in a safe manner.
  Zettelstore is intentionally not aware of any synchronization within its zettel boxes.

  If Zettelstore behaves strangely after a synchronization took place, the page about [[Troubleshooting|00001018000000#working-with-files]] might contain some useful information.
