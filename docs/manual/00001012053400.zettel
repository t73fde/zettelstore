The [[endpoint|00001012920000]] to work with metadata and content of a specific zettel is ''/z/{ID}'', where ''{ID}'' is a placeholder for the zettel identifier (14 digits).

For example, to retrieve some data about this zettel you are currently viewing, just send a HTTP GET request to the endpoint ''/z/00001012053400''[^If [[authentication is enabled|00001010040100]], you must include the a valid [[access token|00001012050200]] in the ''Authorization'' header].
If successful, the output is a JSON object:
```sh
# curl http://127.0.0.1:23123/z/00001012053400
{"id":"00001012053400","url":"/z/00001012053400","meta":{"title":"API: Retrieve data for an exisiting zettel","tags":"#api #manual #zettelstore","syntax":"zmk","role":"manual","copyright":"(c) 2020 by Detlef Stern <ds@zettelstore.de>","lang":"en","license":"CC BY-SA 4.0"},"content":"The endpoint to work with a specific zettel is ''/z/{ID}'', where ''{ID}'' is a placeholder for the zettel identifier (14 digits).\n\nFor example, ...
```

Pretty-printed, this results in:
```
{
  "id": "00001012053400",
  "url": "/z/00001012053400",
  "meta": {

```

Additionally, you can retrieve the raw zettel, without using JSON.
Just add ''raw'' as a query parameter.
Optionally, you may provide which parts of the zettel you are requesting.
In this case, add an additional query parameter ''_part=[[PART|00001012920800]]''.
Valid values are ""zettel"", ""meta"", and ""content"" (the default value).

=== HTTP Status codes
; ''200''
: Retrieval was successful, the body contains an appropriate JSON object.
; ''400''
: Request was not valid. 
  There are several reasons for this.
  Maybe the zettel identifier did not consist of exactly 14 digits.
; ''403''
: You are not allowed to retrieve data of the given zettel.
; ''404''
: Zettel not found.
  You probably used a zettel identifier that is not used in the Zettelstore.
