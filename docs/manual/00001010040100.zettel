To enable authentication, you must create a zettel that stores [[authentication data|00001010040200]] for the owner.
Then you must reference this zettel within the [[startup configuration|00001004010000#owner]] under the key ''owner''.
Once the startup configuration contains a valid [[zettel identifier|00001006050000]] under that key, authentication is enabled.

Please note that you must also set key ''secret'' of the [[startup configuration|00001004010000#secret]] to some random string data (minimum length is 16 bytes) to secure the data exchanged with a client system.
