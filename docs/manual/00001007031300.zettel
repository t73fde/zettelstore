Evaluation blocks are used to enter text that could be evaluated by either Zettelstore or external software.
They begin with at least three tilde characters (""''~''"", U+007E) at the first position of a line.

You can add some [[attributes|00001007050000]] on the beginning line of a verbatim block, following the initiating characters.
The evaluation block supports the default attribute[^Depending on the syntax value.]: when given, all spaces in the text are rendered in HTML as open box characters (U+2423).
If you want to give only one attribute and this attribute is the generic attribute, you can omit the most of the attribute syntax and just specify the value.
It will be interpreted as a [[syntax|00001008000000]] value to evaluate its content.
Not all syntax values are supported by Zettelstore.[^Currently just ""[[draw|00001008050000]]"".]
The main reason for an evaluation block is to be used with external software via the [[Sexpr encoding|00001012920516]].

Any other character in this line will be ignored

Text following the beginning line will not be interpreted, until a line begins with at least the same number of the same characters given at the beginning line.
This allows to enter some tilde characters in the text that should not be interpreted.

For example:
`````zmk
~~~~
~~~
~~~~
`````
will be rendered in HTML as:
:::example
~~~~
~~~
~~~~
:::

`````zmk
~~~{-}
This is  some
text with no 
  real sense.
~~~~
`````
will be rendered as:
:::example
~~~{-}
This is  some
text with no 
  real sense.

`````zmk
